I'd rather blacklist this change for read barrier. The CHECK-NOT here is for testing the register allocator and we should keep it.

I made these changes as the code generated for x86 when we use Baker's read barriers is slightly different here, and contains some more parallel moves; so this test won't work as is.

I've disabled this test for the read barrier configuration in PS6.
