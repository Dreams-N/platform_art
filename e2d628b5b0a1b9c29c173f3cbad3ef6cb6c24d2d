Alternatively, can we not pass raw objects but always handles?

Good point. Having the use of Handle here make things easier. But it does nothing for the caller.

Most of the time, the object is not used after the call ("registry->Add(obj->GetClass())" for instance) so having a handle as parameter adds a constraint. But there are still a few places where it's not like this, like in a loop.

I could add an alternative InternalAdd function taking a Handle instead for such cases.
