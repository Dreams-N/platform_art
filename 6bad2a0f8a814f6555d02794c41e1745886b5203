So that's a soft verification error, and we want Quick to compile it still nicely?

This is not a soft-verification error. You return the first parameter. That's perfectly fine.

OK, did not realize smali would nicely make it the parameter, even though there is no use of v0. Maybe change v1 to p0?

I'm surprised we're not hitting this abort a lot more with Quick. Under what circumstances do we actually hit it? Just if it's a parameter?

This isn't smali being nice, this is dex spec. Parameters are right-aligned in the registers. I left it with a "local" register as that was the setup in the broken up. I can do p0 if that helps you...

And yes, this is a "special" method pattern. A simple return, has a dedicated code generation path in Quick.
