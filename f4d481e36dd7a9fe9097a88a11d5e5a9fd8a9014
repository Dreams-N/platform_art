I'm not sure whether that's very readable. The problem is that there's no obvious, explicit connection between the ScopedIndentation and os at this point. Maybe make things explicit by accessing the stream through the ScopedIndentation? I know it's the same object, and it's also not the best...

I could access it as vios->Stream(). The ScopedIndentation is obviously modifying *vios.

In the end this was only a discussion point. If *you* think it's readable enough as-is, that's fine, too.
