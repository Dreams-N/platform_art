Can you also add Start (for any pass internal setup), Gate (to check whether it is worth doing the pass), and End (for any pass internal teardown).

Though you might be able to get away without Start and End if the pattern is that the pass itself sets up internal data structures in Run.

If you intend to write a pass that needs all this, why not putting all that in the pass itself for now?

This abstraction is mostly for factoring out the visualizer dump and graph checking code.  I'd prefer not thinking too much about a greater scheme for compiler passes for now.
