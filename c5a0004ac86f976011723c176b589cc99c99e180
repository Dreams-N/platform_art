Note: This adds additional dependencies that were not previously there: bouncycastle, okhttp, conscrypt, and apache-xml in addition to core-libart and core-oj.

Does anyone know if those new dependencies are appropriate to include or exclude from this list?

I think you'd need to check the master-art(-host) manifest to see if they're available there. Nicolas' bots all run with that reduced branch.

(I think they should all be there, considering they're required for the core image)

They appear to already be picked up as part of a dependency on the core image, so this shouldn't break anything.
