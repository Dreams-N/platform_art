How can this pass the verifier?

It doesn't, it's a soft error. Question is whether it's correct to make it a hard error.

OK.

Calin: before we go too crazy into fixing fuzzer discovered problems, I think we should fall back to Quick when a method had a soft failure during verification. Optimizing has some requirements on the verifier that Quick doesn't have.

Andreas: we need to discuss about what's soft and hard. In this case, I don't see why this is soft, as it will also fail at runtime. Isn't the assumption that runtime could recover from a soft failure (like missing class reference or something)?
