I believe the this season's fashion trend is to wear nullptr rather than NULL.  Might just want to make this void anyway, unless you have an idea that it might return something useful in the future.  Your choice.

It would probably be good to add a comment that this might be enhanced by verifying that the number of instructions from IT to here matches the expected skip range of the IT.
