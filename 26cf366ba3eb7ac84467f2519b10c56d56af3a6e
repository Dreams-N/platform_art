This is something I need to work on - we haven't switched to Jack with Checker because some tests expect DEX exactly as generated by dx.

Fine by me to leave this here for now. I'll try to get to this asap.

Short term, we could hack and activate Jack tests if '--experimental lambdas'

Yes, of course this is all very temporary (hopefully :-) and I just started this so to enable Igor and me to work on lambdas with some basic testing in place.

In any case, I added a TODO just to make sure we are all aware of the temporary nature of this :-)
