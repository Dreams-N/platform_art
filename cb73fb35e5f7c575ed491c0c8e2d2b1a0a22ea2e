If we care about this really, I could put the ID that contains the entrance map to this one, ie which BB has an exit that coincides with its entry. This would require to add a temporary in some form or another for the current algorithm's implementation but then would transform a int32_t * num_ssa_regs * num_blocks memory foot print to a BasicBlockId * num_blocks + BasicBlockId.

to reduce the memory footprint, we could put these to int8_t and the num_uses and num_defs too, that would make this part of the change not change the memory foot print

I suppose this change is fine (as memory footprints go)
