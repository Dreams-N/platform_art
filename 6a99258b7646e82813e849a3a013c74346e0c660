An alternative idea may be to add a class table as a whole to the reference cache. That way, we don't need to keep the card dirty. Did you think about that?

I think that would work too, but I think it could cause problems later with class unloading. How about just using the current approach for now?

Say why we can't add them to the reference cache (since we can't store a pointer into the hash set of the class table)?
