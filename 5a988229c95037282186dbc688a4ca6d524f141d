This is a bit misleading IMHO.  The documentation on `adb shell start` is scarce, but from what I read and understood from http://developer.android.com/tools/help/shell.html#othershellcommands and https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/master/toolbox/start_stop.cpp, `adb shell start` start or restarts the following services:

* netd
* surfaceflinger
* zygote
* zygote_secondary

As the zygote(s) is (are) (re)started, I understand the framework is "(re)started" as well.

Maybe rephrase this comment?
