You didn't want to keep this tag marking that it's deduped?

Well, compiling with debug information will also disable the deduplication, so this does not happen anymore.

More importantly, although I am happy with the tag in .symstr, it is fairly non-conventional in DWARF and I would like to remove it.  The fact that we just pretty print the method signature and write it as DW_AT_name is also a hack.  I intend to fix that in the next CL.
