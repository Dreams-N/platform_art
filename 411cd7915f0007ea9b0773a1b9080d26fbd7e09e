I really don't understand why you're pushing this hack when you here so clearly state what the issue is. That we Erase(), which doesn't unlink. *That* is the issue, which wouldn't require your hackish special-casing of zero.

I have a patch for that, but I need to inspect all other sites of Erase() to decide whether it's OK to make it unlink(), or whether FdFile should expose Unlink() itself.
