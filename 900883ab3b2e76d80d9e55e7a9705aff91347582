Isn't this just i++, if you say in line 1669 charAt(i)?

Otherwise the whole set of comments should be updated to be correct, e.g., formulate it in C style with "# if *ptr == ch"

The address of the i'th character of this is (address of this) + MIRROR_STRING_VALUE_OFFSET + i*2. Here A0 holds (address of this) + i*2 (see lines 1664 & 1665 above); the remaining MIRROR_STRING_VALUE_OFFSET is provided by the LHU instruction in line 1669 above. Technically, you're right that it's not really this.charAt(i++) but I think it's not really i++ either.

Do you think that "i++" would be more clear to the reader in this case? Maybe something else?
