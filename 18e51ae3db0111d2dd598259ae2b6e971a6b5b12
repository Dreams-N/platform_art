I've chatted with Wojciech, letting him know I strongly, strongly, strongly prefer a switch on strings, and then hard code the allocation.

Also sounds like a good idea to have a standardized way of naming the passes which has two parts: one common to all instances (like a class name) and one that is unique.

So e.g "instruction_simplifier::after_bce" would split the name and instantiate HInstructionSimplifier.
