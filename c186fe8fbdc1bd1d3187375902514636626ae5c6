Does that mean I should rename hother to other in the code? I did this to be consistent with hnot (which in turn could not be named 'not' since it's a keyword in C++).

How can this happen? (inputs of different types)

Interesting.

Kevin copied that from implementations for other instructions. I had a look but I cannot understand how this could happen here or for other nodes.
- Type conversions implicitly removed. Cannot be the reason since neither int->long nor long->int are implicitly removed.
- The constant folding pass correctly updates the type of constants through HTypeConversion.

Roland, you implemented the commit introducing that. Can you help us here?
