This is a very unfortunate copy-paste mistake, for this code happens to still work for any char that isn't larger than 8 bits (ie. the characters of ASCII and ISO-8859-1, and the current test cases use ASCII test characters and therefore still pass) but it will truncate all other characters (which totally breaks deserialization, which is why I found it). I've sent you a patch for review now:
