Probably not super-important, but is find implemented such that "" is a good fast-path? Else a check for nullptr might be better than using "" by default.

Considering what else is going on here, and that oatdump is not so performance sensitive, I'm more in favor of not trying to be clever. Adding a null check would look like noise. But I don't mind adding it.
