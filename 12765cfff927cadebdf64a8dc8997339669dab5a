This is technically a functional change. Sometimes null means you don't care for the side effect.

Agreed, I imagine might want something like optional<out<T>> for that kind of use case.

The main idea is to relieve the callee from having to null-check every pointer before assigning into it (see line 132 "non-null non-const").

(optional is already in C++ technical fundamentals, but we probably want to roll our own until it makes it into std)
