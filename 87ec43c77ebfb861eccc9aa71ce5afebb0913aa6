Not your change, but why didn't we decide on a specific internal Error?

There's only ZipError as a subclass, I think. Initialization abort is kind of an internal error, so it's the right category IMHO. We didn't want to introduce another class. And as I discussed with shertz a couple of weeks back, changing to -1 like we do for deopt has other complications.
