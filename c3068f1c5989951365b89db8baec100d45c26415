A more complete explanation for this would be appreciated. Is it not enough to have the register blocked? Why do you also need to block the pair?

When we allocate a register pair we only look at the blocked_register_pairs_. This is basically to keep it in sync with bloked_core_registers_. Otherwise we could allocate for example EAX_EDX when EAX is already allocated.

Obviously, we could just do extra tests during allocations but this way seems simpler, cleaner and also keeps things in a consistent state.

There's no code actually that can generate this yet... and there's no dex instruction for multiply a long with a literal. 

I wonder if we should bother. Left it as TODO since we might want to consider it for optimizations (?). same for other arches.

const-wide/high16 v2, #ff
mul-long v0, v0, v2

I would guess that for this case the HGraph actually creates a constant node for second operand location. In fact, I bet that the TODO here is a functional problem since it will go to memory case which may not have updated location.

yea... I agree :) hence the TODO. I added the comment to get this kind of feedback.

I'll fill the missing bits in a follow up CL.
