Shouldn't the code here match the code above (lines 1159 to 1165) ?

I think that the idea was that a promoted register on a 64 bit machine should handle both 32 and 64 bit values, so it is good to combine them.

In fact, should the code above be changed to handle machines with merged single/double registers in the same manner as 64 bit registers here? 

I have to admit that I don't understand this code too well.

Yes, that's basically what Ian means. The floating point counting above should look like the counting for the integral types.
