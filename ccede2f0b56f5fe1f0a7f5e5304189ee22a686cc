This is overkill, as arm_lir.h says that only half of them are promotable, and the rest is caller-save.

I'd prefer for now we didn't do this, it will be a performance regression. SetFpr and GetFpr should be able to fail and when they do we should report that up to the debugger caller. So float values are best effort for now.

You're right. It should be the same used by the compiler.

I understand your concern about performance. I didn't evaluate the cost of saving FPRs so far. On the other hand, it'd be a regression for developers if we can't read/write float values from the debugger in this case.
