I think you need an or with GetIncludeDebugSymbols here. You can include debug symbols without generating GDB info.

I wanted to ask - What is difference between those two?
I noticed in the option parser that gdb-info implies debug-symbols, but not vice versa.

I'm afraid I don't know. First I thought it's something that you added in one of your previous CLs.  Looks that it's been here for a while and not used. Smells like rotten code to me.

IncludeDebugSymbols is a subset of GDBInformation (in fact, the latter forces the former). Currently IncludeDebugSymbols writes at least the symtab and such.

As such, it sounds like you want to change this back, and potentially clean up in a follow-up CL.
