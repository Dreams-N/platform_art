Is this to optimize baseline? Otherwise I'd assume constant folding should have taken care of this. Maybe add a comment?

fyi, baseline is going deprecated (debuggable doesn't use it anymore).

I assumed so, but it was my only guess why there's still an AND with 0 or 0xFFFFFFFF. Otherwise somebody should check our constant folding.

(Or is this some lower opt mode thing for debuggability? In that case it still seems better to be explicit and replace the HIR with the HIntConstant or whatever)

Ditto.
