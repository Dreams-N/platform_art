I guess ptr being null isn't hit today, as otherwise things would have been crashing?

Sort of, the error only happens for the case where someone does reset on an null unique_ptr to a non-null new pointer.

This should not be necessary.

~unique_ptr is specificied to have no effect when get() == nullptr.

Also, reset() (usually called by the destructor) is specified to only delete when the stored value was not null.
