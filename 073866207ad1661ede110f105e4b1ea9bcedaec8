I don't understand this comment.

My understanding of what the function does is this: given a dex location and the path of a dalvik cache directory, return the path to what the oat file should be named. This is done by turning the dex location into a file name (replacing '/' with '@' to get a valid filename), and adding '@classes.dex'. Does it do something different for the boot image?

After thinking some more, there is an ambiguity about what should happen if the dex location isn't absolute. Two sensible options are:
 1. Turn a relative dex location into an absolute dex location and form the oat file name from that.
 2. Treat a relative dex location as a separate dex location from the dex location corresponding to the absolute path of the relative dex location.

I had only thought of (2), not (1) when I posted this change. It seems a shame to add the work and complexity of (1) given that nobody uses relative dex locations. I'll have to think more about what I want to do here.

Thoughts?

need cases for without leading / now as well.
