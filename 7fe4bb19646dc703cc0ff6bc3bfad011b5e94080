Move this inside the following if branch, because that's the only place it is used.

Minor nit, but I think all the other "-Xno" options don't have a - right after the 'no'

Yes, but it looked wrong to me. English reading kicks in for me, and so I get "nodex"-file-fallback. But I'm open to changing that if the team thinks it's better.

That's a very similar thing as reading "noimage"-dex2oat. Is that confusing too? Maybe we should rename the other ones then?

What about

  -X[no]fallback-to-dex-file

?

There's also the notion that the description isn't very intuitive, I'm not 100% sure what it means even after reading the diff. What does it mean to "fall back to a dex file?"

As far as I can tell it means fall back to interpreting from dex file, instead of executing the code from the oat file [when the oat file is missing].

So why not "-X[no]fallback-to-interpreter" ? What am I missing here?

Did you want to make it like the other ones and have the -Xdex-file-fallback and the -Xnodex-file-fallback options?

It seemed like a special one-off thing like X:CheckJNI. I know it is now formatted like the dual options. Critique is welcome.

this = 'deleting the instance'.

I think it's worth explicitly stating that we are leaking memory here.

Why is this different from the verify_ assign statement?
Should it use runtime_options.GetOrDefault? Or should the verify_ assignment use !runtime_options.Exists?

Verify has text options and is binary: you can say verification on or off. This goes into Igor's question on whether the new option should be binary, too. I used Intel's approach here, and think NoDexFileFallback is singular enough (it's like -X:CheckJni) that only turning it off is necessary (and then you use Exists).
