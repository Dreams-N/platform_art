Here and in several other places "pointer" and its size is not what's being actually used if we're trying to use the right terms in the code. Specifically, here we aren't storing 2 pointers to memory and aren't adding a pointer size to the offset. It's a word (two words) here. I'm confused. Could you elaborate here and in the commit message?

You need to run a script on the changed files to detect overly long lines and fix them.
