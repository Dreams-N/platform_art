Where?

Not that I care :) but I find 'maybe' more vague than potentially. Note that I use Potentially also in the builder. so I'm staying consistent :)

As future enhancement, it makes sense to not block the frame register either. In Dalvik, we saw benefit in doing that because many inner loops don't have escapes to runtime and it was useful when register pressure was high to reduce spills.
