so far we used "Maybe". (it's also shorter :) )

Where?

Not that I care :) but I find 'maybe' more vague than potentially. Note that I use Potentially also in the builder. so I'm staying consistent :)

I don't care that much either, but I think I stumble more across Maybe* pattern. A quick search in the builder shows that we have more Maybes then Potentials :), though the number is small.

Hey that's cheating since you introduced most of the maybes with the stats :)

Maybe keep the comment with the one register pushed at entry (LR)?

As future enhancement, it makes sense to not block the frame register either. In Dalvik, we saw benefit in doing that because many inner loops don't have escapes to runtime and it was useful when register pressure was high to reduce spills.
