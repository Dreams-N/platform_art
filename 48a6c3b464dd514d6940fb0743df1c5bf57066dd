It's a bit confusing to me that we are writing both the -Wframe-larger-than values into a single command line and then expecting that only the last one holds true (i.e. let's hope nobody reorders these lines). It's ok by me, but the ART folks might feel differently, since it is just command-line bloat.

Yes, we don't have a gcc-only cflags variable yet. So the current way to set something differently is to set the gcc value in LOCAL_CFLAGS and then overwrite it with clang value in LOCAL_CLANG_CFLAGS.
