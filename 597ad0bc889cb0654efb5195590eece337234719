For intel ISA these are mostly clean supersets 
avx2 ==> avx ==> sse4.2 ==> sse4.1 => ssse3.
other orthogonal features are
tsx popcount 

So we could expect 'avx2,popcount' to be passes as a feature set. But not 'avx2,avs,sse4_2,sse4_2,popcount'

Do you expect instruction_set_feature will be set to 'avx sse4_1 sse4_2' ?
If not, SetSSE4.1 should also SetHasSSSE3 and so on.

The 'HasFeatureX' queries should centralize the logic of this set inclusion. So optimizer/backend can query for just HasSSE4.1 and get true even for avx.
