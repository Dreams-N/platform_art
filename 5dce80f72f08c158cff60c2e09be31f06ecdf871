danalbert says there are no tests in libc++ for any precision guarantees, and that this likely bottoms out in libm. Considering there were issues on at least x86 (see sqrt discussion there), I don't think it's this simple...

Could you paste the link of the x86 discussion?

Roland, you could still do this change only for int/long operations, and then if possible, do the float/double.

Can't find it anymore, but here's one CL in ART: https://android-review.googlesource.com/167350. There were others in libcore.

(I do remember Mark saying that Intel had to use some precision library. E.g., we could use fdlibm.)

There is a version of libm for x86 with improved speed.  Not sure about improved accuracy.  Added Serguei
