Catching exception is a property of method and not whether the optimization is enabled. Thus, I am not sure that this makes sense to call like this. I would prefer simply marking it to true if there are indeed catch blocks.

Can you use SetInitialBits instead?

From what I can tell, you are disabling SimplifyCFG because all blocks are visited. Is there a reason why?

I would prefer naming it "has_catch_handlers"

Maybe comment that this is an over-approximation since it doesn't seem you are actually analyzing what is live into those blocks. I wonder if it would be cleaner to integrate catch blocks into graph and then replace them with deopt nodes once we successfully model the data flow.
