The native code was giving back fake results so as to pass even in configurations where the test is meaningless. I've cleaned up the native code (as I changed from assertX to isX), and I think it's better to just disable this part of the test in meaningless situations.

(Note that black-listing isn't right because you still want to test interpreter mode, for example. And yes, I strongly believe these tests belong in this run-test. If you disagree, a follow-up could split this out.)
