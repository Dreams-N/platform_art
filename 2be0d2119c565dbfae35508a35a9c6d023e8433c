Not very sure, but is there a chance that we would need to do this check after SuspendAll()? Otherwise, there's still a small window of time (from here to SuspendAll() in line 1424) where multiple threads could potentially be racing?

The race is not possible since we set the collector_type_running_ before we exit the loop. Other transitions would need to wait for the GC to complete. I'll add a comment.
