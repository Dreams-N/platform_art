The most significant impact of reducing this from 5 to 3 will be in how the x86-64 generates packed-switch for 4 or 5 values - using jump table instead of compare/branch - and I'm fine with that; anyway, it should be the codegen's responsibility to generate the compare/branch series if it's deemed better. You preserved the behavior for x86.

(I find it odd that the graph builder assumes responsibility for deciding when to generate a series of compare/jump. Reducing this should reduce the compile time and memory usage but it may in rare circumstances lead to missed optimizations - all of that should be insignificant though.)

I agree that this decision should be made in the code generator.  This was a carry-over from Quick

Using temp_reg as signed requires that kPackedSwitchCompareJumpThreshold is small. Please add a static_assert.

I think you can drop this if you replace the signed LT with the unsigned LO below.

Are you sure? What about lower_bound == MIN_VALUE and value == MAX_VALUE?

Same as ARM: use "lo" below and remove this branch.

(But not really applicable to mips/mips64 as far as I can tell.)
