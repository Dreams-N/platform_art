In the above TODO, can you elaborate a bit more on the issue with the .macro in OS/X, along the line of .macro uses $0, $1,... as arguments on OS/X and their assembler fails to assemble if those $0, $1,... for different macros exist on the same line, which is how I interpreted the issue in our in-person discussion.

As for the name suffixes of these macros, instead of numbers 1-6, I prefer names that correspond to the entry points like GENERATE_ALLOC_ENTRYPOINTS_ALLOC_OBJECT and GENERATE_ALLOC_ENTRYPOINTS_ALLOC_OBJECT_WITH_ACCESS. The reason is that with numbers, if we insert a new entrypoint into the middle of the list of these six entrypoints in the future, we'd most likely have to renumber them all, as opposed to simply add a line there.
