just curious for my own understanding of this change

the [] has slightly different semantics than at()

can't you just add a check to the at operator to make everything checked (and at also throws out_of_range)

We don't want to throw or catch C++ exceptions, ever. So at() was using an unsupported way of asserting that the index is correct. With this change we DCHECK() in the operator[].
