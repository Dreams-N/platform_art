Very curious to see numbers for this. I guess the hardware divide is still too crappy for this.

According to the ARM documents, sdiv is very slow. When I did the similar thing in Quick on arm32, it is about 2 times faster on a15, a53 and a57.

But I guess denver has a much different implementation. I tested it on Nexus-9 this time. It is about the same with or without this patch.
