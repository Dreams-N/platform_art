interesting. is this the only text relocation in art? if so, when we remove dalvik we might also be able to remove the dynamic linker hack that allows DT_TEXTREL on x86 because dalvik's ridden with them (and it was kind of hard to have a useful system without dalvik).

Unfortunately we're getting non-GOT references into bionic that we need to get to the bottom of (fmod[f] and memcpy).

this should use the VAR macro for assemblers that don't support named macro arguments (OS/X "as" I mean you)

dead code.
I think this is part of the 32 (edi) vs 64 (rdi) bit confusion. Its going to be more future proof if we just make this rdi. Its a bit more compact to use edi. Elsewhere we're already making the assumption that references can be 64-bit (see treatment of the ArtMethod on line 41) , so I'd go with rdi, testq (rather than testl), movq (rather than movl), etc.
