Indeed, that's a bit obscure. I changed the way temps are being represented in the regalloc by not refering to the instruction that requires the temp. Therefore defined_by_ is only set if the live interval corresponds to the live interval of the instruction.

Since the temp and the instruction that requires the temp share the same lifetime start, calling GetInstructionFromPosition returns the instrurtion that returns the temp.

I've added a helper method, and some comments.
