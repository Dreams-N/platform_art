Probably best not to spend too much time reviewing this yet - it's just a snapshot of work in progress and includes a lot of scaffolding code that will go away before it's ready for review.  I did want to give you all the flavor of what I'm up too - but expect things to look worse before they look better.  I've still got some int -> RegStorage conversion to go, and then I'll finally begin the actual pair operation cleanup.

Use const RegStorage rs_rAX = rs_r0; instead?
