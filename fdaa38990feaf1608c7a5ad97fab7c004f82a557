Such a map is already being created in the compiler, why do you need to create it again?

This CL removes it from the compiler, and delays its creation until this point, removing the need to keep it in memory in the meantime.

If the quick compiler gets killed or if we do not need to support native debugging there, I can remove the need to materialize the vector in memory altogether.

Oh yeah, i've done a half way review. Cool :-) Still, it looks like the code in the compiler was doing it for each instruction, whereas now you're only doing it for stack map entries. Is that intended?
