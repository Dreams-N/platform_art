so I do think we want to keep the boot.art target for now

OK, I'll leave it here.
But again, it's unreliable to install boot.art by adding this phony package to PRODUCT_PACKAGES, because the build system needs the installed file $(ALL_MODULES.$(LOCAL_MODULE).INSTALLED) of the package to be in out/target/product/*/system to get the dependency established.

Don't we need to have some rule for the boot.art to be installed? even if it just to have the rule for the copy from the built location to the installed location? or is that the build project now too?

Oh these 2 deps won't work expected: they will just trigger the "touch" command in build/core/phony_package.

yeah, might as well nuke these.
