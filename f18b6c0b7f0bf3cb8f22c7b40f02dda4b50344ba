Aren't you doing it in the assembler_thum2_test.cc?

I meant, "don't forget to check (and fix) the implementation of art::arm::Thumb2Assembler::sbfx as it does not always produce the expected results".  It's gone in PS2 anyway.  :)

Yes, would be nice to know why the shell around it is necessary.

I am using the same strategy as in AssemblerTest::Objdump and AssemblerTest::DisassembleBinary to let AssemblerTest::GetAssemblerCommand contain arguments and be used with Exec, by encaspulating the whole shell command line in a single string passed to /bin/sh.  Otherwise (i.e. before this change), the shell would complain that is cannot find a file (a program) named "/path/to/as -mthumb".

Should I add this explanation to one (or possibly all) of these methods?
