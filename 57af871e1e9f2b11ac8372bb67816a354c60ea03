Please put a comment why this is here. Why is it not possible to unify this and do the set_cc work above, where one would expect it.

I guess it's awesome thumb encoding, but then that should be explained.

Out of curiosity, did you verify that the instruction was actually wrongly executed?

My reading of encoding T3 in the ARMv7-M manual (best manual I could find for this) is that it should have been correct as-is for almost all cases (T3 has more special cases than T4).

Maybe make this the same style as above:
 set_cc ? B20 : 0
