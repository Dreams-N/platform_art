There's an issue here since these pairs fail the ExpectedPairLayout() test.
Having this exception is rather annoying and I can think of:
a) adding a flag to not check that a pair has the expected layout
b) requesting a proper pair and work around it with various moves.
c) ?

I would go with a) since b) implies a lot of working.
What do you think?

For x86, we actually block this pair from being use. We don't fail because baseline checks if the individual regs are blocked and not the whole pair.
