Fwiw, removing suspend checks from leaf methods is dubiously correct wrt starving the garbage collector (introducing long times to safe point, a form of GC pause). A large leaf method may have no suspend checks. The worst case is a method calling nothing but large leaf methods, the first safe point will happen at return from that method. There are also no suspend checks at method entry, so combining recursion with large leaf methods is an easy way to starve the GC, cause pauses, jank...

Given the refocus on JIT with profile driven AOT, and functional method inlining, is there an abundance of leaf methods where this dubious optimization is beneficial as an overall means of reducing  total code size? Note, not removing the leaf method suspend checks would only be part of doing this right. The second part would be removing suspend checks from loop back edges dominated by method calls.

That's a good point Ian. Worth filing a bug to start the conversation. Last time we checked, removing suspend checks in leafs was worthwhile on most benchmarks.

Thanks. It is to be expected that removing suspend checks does improve benchmark scores, it doesn't make it correct :-) If it is winning on benchmarks then it is evidence of method dispatch cost, which is a symptom of broken inlining.

I was going to keep a DCHECK here to make sure leaf method suspend checks were always removed before register allocation, but the DCHECK interfered with unit testing of the register allocator, since optimization passes are not run. It should be ok to leave out the DCHECK, though; removing the suspend checks is an optimization, and not necessary for correctness.

I don't think this is set at this point. You're probably either removing all suspend checks at entry or keeping them all :)

You're right, it looks like this is not set until liveness analysis runs. Thank you for catching this.

This means I can't move this to prepare_for_register_allocation, though, since we'll have the same issue. It would be nice if marking a method as a leaf were not tied up with liveness analysis, but creating a new pass just for that is not cheap. Thoughts?

Fixing the TODO is not so trivial :) So we need liveness analysis to run before marking a method as leaf/not leaf, can we move the removal of the suspend check in liveness analysis instead of register allocator?

That's heavyweight for just removing a suspend check: you're visiting the whole graph here. Ideally this should be done in prepare_for_register_allocation.

Agreed, I'll move this to prepare_for_register_allocation. I must have misunderstood your email about this. (Edit: see my other comment regarding prepare_for_register_allocation.)

I had the same comment on being a bit heavy for basically one optimization only, but I also see Andreas' point on not finding an artificial place to put it. Perhaps this could be a more general "leaf method" optimization phase, that can later extend to more stuff?

Either way, once that is done, please make a few checker tests on this feature

nit: this can be moved to private section. but looking at all other phases, we don't seem to have a consistent story on this :-)
