I was going to keep a DCHECK here to make sure leaf method suspend checks were always removed before register allocation, but the DCHECK interfered with unit testing of the register allocator, since optimization passes are not run. It should be ok to leave out the DCHECK, though; removing the suspend checks is an optimization, and not necessary for correctness.

I don't think this is set at this point. You're probably either removing all suspend checks at entry or keeping them all :)

That's heavyweight for just removing a suspend check: you're visiting the whole graph here. Ideally this should be done in prepare_for_register_allocation.
