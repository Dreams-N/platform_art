Not sure if setting this tag globally might be frowned upon. 

A lot of functions in Runtime don't get used at boot time only, if someone adds ATRACE logging there and doesn't remember to change the ATRACE_TAG, they will get very confusing systrace info.

An alternative might be calling the C functions directly without the macros (similar to how the Java calls take a tag directly).
