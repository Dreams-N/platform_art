Actually forget my comment. You should keep the kCall. Making it a kCall makes it that there is no live register, so you don't need to save them in both "slow paths".

So you think I can drop the DispatchToSlowPathCode below?

Why is that not in the assembly impl?

Because you can avoid it in the case of constants. Quick is doing that, I haven't implemented it for optimizing (, yet, potentially).

If you were to move SaveLiveRegisters and RestoreLiveRegisters to CodeGenerator would you still need this?

There's some logic involved storing the offsets of the spilled registers. I think that should not pollute the CodeGenerator.

So in case you're commment on the kCall doesn't apply, I'd rather introduce some helper class that's used here and in the SlowPathCode.
