I don't think it's as easy as this. Until now there were no local values except the arguments with obvious v0=arg, v1=test allocation. Adding this piece of code allocates a new object and the vreg allocation is not clear any more. In fact, having cherry-picked this, I get v2=arg which breaks the native vreg checks.

You might need to rewrite this in smali...
