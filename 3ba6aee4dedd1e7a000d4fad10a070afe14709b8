nit: is ANDROID_HOST_OUT supported by the build server? 

I don't think that's an issue right now because we launch these tests with 'make test-art-...' where JACK_CLASSPATH is exported already. 
People using run-test directly will likely run it in a configured Android tree where ANDROID_HOST_OUT is set.
