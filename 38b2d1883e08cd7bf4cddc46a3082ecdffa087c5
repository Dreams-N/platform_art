Why is this named this way?

Because the instruction encoding changed when we moved to R6.

Sorry, the whole naming scheme is not intuitive at all. To me this reads as "Rev2 variant of Clz." In which case the question would be "Why is this not protected for R1?"

The revison suffixes are indeed a bit non-intuitive.
R6 is used for instructions that were introduced with R6.
R2, OTOH, has a dual purpose:
- for instructions that were introduced with R2 and available in R2 and further revisions (e.g. R6)
- for instructions that were available prior to R2 (i.e. in R1) but changed encoding or were removed in R6

IOW, R2 means either the instruction appeared in R2 or was last available in R2.
