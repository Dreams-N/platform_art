Does some compiler define this?  Or is this just wishful thinking?

Yes, wishful thinking. :-)

More seriously, I did not really know what to do here, so was hoping for some feedback on the matter. I can also leave it at simply false....

You can just leave it as is but add a comment, or do what prefers_locked_add does and just default to false.

I would tend to leave as is with a comment.

I agree with Mark.  Unless we have evidence that `__POPCNT__` works as expected on GCC and Clang, we should default `has_POPCNT` to `false` on x86.

actually, now that this is a feature, it becomes much harder to test with a checker. 

it would be nice if the checker could include features as I sketch in this TODO

any other ideas for this?

Maybe file a bug for a Checker feature request (and add its number to this TODO)?
