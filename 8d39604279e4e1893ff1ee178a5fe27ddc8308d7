This seems a bit confusing to pass in the current_method this way. Is the GetCurrentMethod() function expensive? Otherwise, it might be easier to understand what this code is doing if you just make the call DumpNativeStack(..., GetCurrentMethod(nullptr), " native: ", false); and remove the passing of the variable around.

But this is a nit, so feel free to ignore.

It would be nice if the prefix were "bridge:" rather than "native:" for the down call frame. But anyway.
