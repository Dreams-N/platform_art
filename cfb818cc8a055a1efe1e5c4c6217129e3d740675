m allows [reg + #disp] addressing and GCC was complaining about using that in conjunction with ldrexd (my belief is that's ok for thumb2 but not ARM32). Q forces the memory operand to be in a register, which was achieved before by using an r constraint and then placing in "[%0]"

"=m" ? It isn't read under these circumstances. =m should do.
