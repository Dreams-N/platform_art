so this is where that extern hack points to right?

Ian, is there a better way to structure this?

hmm, I think we just changed not to depend on llvm/ except for portable. (you can "repo init -b master-art-host" and it won't include external/llvm). We'll have to reconsider that

Yes, please don't bring back this dependency. ART depends on libunwind, which already has its own dwarf.h that could fit your needs. Alternatively, you could create in a file in the art repo with what you actually use from dwarf.
