Why is out lowercase again? Usually we have capital first letter for classes.

Yeah, I could change that if we really wanted to.

That being said, there's a rule in google3 about using "lower case with underscores" for cheap (functions). If we extend that to cheap types as well it would be ok.

I don't think they had zero-cost abstractions in mind with their current rules, since most classes have more than one field in them.

Personally the associations I automaticaly get, CamelCase = expensive (think Java classes), lower_case = cheap (think C or java primitives) and I don't see why it should be any different because something is a function or a class, it just seems like it should be uniform.

Forgot to split a few on their own lines.
