don't depend on non-local phone targets like adb, libnativehelper, and libjavacore.

those work with m/mma/mmma, but not mm and mmm. if you use the proper makefile variables like above in art-host, you will get told if the files are missing and you need to do a broader build, but it will work fine if they are there.
