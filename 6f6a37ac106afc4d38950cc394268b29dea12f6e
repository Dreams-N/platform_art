This looks odd given that we now compare 2 characters at a time. Unfortunately, this is hard to guess right and one has to measure a lot and it even depends on the actual hardware. Some experimentation would be in order. Things to try:

1. Iterate forward rather than backward. I read CPUs are more likely to actively prefetch with this access pattern. (+1 temp as you can't compare temp1 with a constant for the termination condition.)

2. Use post-indexed LDRs as in PS4 (+2 temps).

3. Change the loop back to use an unconditional back branch as in PS5. I heard this is good for Cortex-A53 but doesn't really affect Cortex-A57. No idea how that works out for Thumb2 on Nexus 9.

4. Add explicit PLDs to the loop.

I also like to have `-O0' in debug mode as it make debugging easier, but does everybody in the teem agree?  It would probably slow the tests down a lot.

I didn't mean to commit this, sorry about that!

Nit: I just discovered DCHECK_ALIGNED thanks to Mathieu; use it here as well?
