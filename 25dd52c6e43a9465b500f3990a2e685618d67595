It's odd that `ReadBarrierSlowPathX86::ReadBarrierSlowPathX86` and `CodeGeneratorX86::GenerateReadBarrier` have non matching signatures (the last two arguments are swapped):

  ReadBarrierSlowPathX86::ReadBarrierSlowPathX86(HInstruction* instruction,
                                                 Location out,
                                                 Location ref,
                                                 Location obj,
                                                 Location index,
                                                 uint32_t offset);

vs

  void CodeGeneratorX86::GenerateReadBarrier(HInstruction* instruction,
                                             Location out,
                                             Location ref,
                                             Location obj,
                                             uint32_t offset,
                                             Location index);

Shouldn't the former match the latter (so that `index` can still have a default value in `CodeGeneratorX86::GenerateReadBarrier`)?

So the problem is that the register allocator does not consider fixed register inputs to be "live registers" at the point of the call. We might need another CallKind to make it so.

For example, I think we do not currently support a fixed input that needs to survive a slow path.

Yes. I discussed this issue with Mingyao, and tried several other approaches including modifying register allocator slightly, or adding a fake HIR instruction to record live registers, but they didn't work.
