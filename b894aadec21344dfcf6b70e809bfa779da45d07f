There's still some piece of the puzzle that I'm not getting. If the class can be resolved, we'll say yes to the outer class. But then if we inline something that has no access to it, who prevents the "is_referrer" to be true? Isn't it there you should DCHECK?

This is without inlining. I updated the comment in HLoadClass DCHECK. 

The inliner already has the necessary checks to not inline unverified methods.
