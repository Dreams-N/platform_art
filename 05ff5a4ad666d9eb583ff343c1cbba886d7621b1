I'd almost rather this would've been a #if < c++14 conditional, at least that way it's more visible once the entire codebase goes to C++14.

vmarko might have more to say about it.

I suggested that to Dan, but I think the comment is enough.

In the end this is short-term, and should be reverted once we move (back) to Clang...

Dan, did you make the current compiler bug a blocking issue on this bug?
