I think the name of this function is now meaningless. It is supposed to return the InstructionSetFeatures for the C++ program that's running. For example, if it's running on a x86 it'll tell me the level of SSE support. Doing this for anything other than the runtime ISA doesn't make sense. Why would a x86 have __ARM #defines? I believe you are just after a way to fake up a InstructionSetFeatures, why not use the FromVariant/FromBitmap routines that are used for this purpose in cross-compilation?
