Nit: it's just a matter of taste, but I would write it

  position % 2 == 0

instead. :-)

It is indeed a matter of taste :) I got used somehow to the '&'. I'll go ahead and submit this, but let me know if you think it's unreadable with the '&'.

Don't worry, your version with `&' is perfectly readable. :)

I'm not familiar with everything here, but is this the first instruction of the block? (position + 1) / 2 for a start looks odd.

Yes it is. position is the lifetime start of the block. Here position is odd, which means just doing + 1 will lead you to the first instruction of the block.
