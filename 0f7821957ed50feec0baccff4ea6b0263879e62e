I don't believe that this will work correctly.  The X86 code generator assumes that there is only 1 instruction to compute the address, as its offset is saved and used when generating the fixup.

A better fix is to just return if the graph has irreducible loops, and not generate it everywhere.  As these are optimizations, not correctness changes, that is a better solution.

I am not sure how to handle this one.
