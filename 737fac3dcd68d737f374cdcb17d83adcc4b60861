I think the commit message is a bit misleading: you're still technically allocating space for a VIXL macro assembler from/within the ART ARM64 assembler.  Maybe say something like "Make the VIXL macro assembler allocation part of ART's ARM64 assembler's"?

This feels odd that the code generator has access to one of the assembler's internal fields.  Could we turn `art::arm64::Arm64Assembler::vixl_masm_` into a private member and add an accessor?

Thanks for the refactoring!

So I assume it is fine to have the VIXL macro assembler being default constructed?
