Will this inverted mask include the stack pointer? For the graph coloring allocator, live_registers will include the stack pointer, so this may overestimate the number of slow path spills by one.

I addressed that in PS3 by excluding blocked registers from the live_registers.

I didn't look at the graph coloring in detail but the handling of blocked registers seems to waste a lot of memory (and presumably time) by constructing interference edges. It would be better to pretend that those registers simply don't exist.
