The naming for this function seems weird now. I think it would be better to clean this up so the value is filled in where the HInterfaceInvoke is constructed (at that point you also have the ArtMethod).

I wonder whether we should give the IMT size as a parameter (to remove the modulo at the call-site). Pros? Cons?
