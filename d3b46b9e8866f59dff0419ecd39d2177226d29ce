This macro doesn't update the index. This is inconsistent with the other three and makes it difficult to read. I think you should move the "gpr_index = 4" here for consistency.

Alternatively, none of these macros would touch the index and they would instead increment the arg pointer in the delay slot.

Changed it. Code is more readable now, but it is a little bit slower because of an extra branch.
