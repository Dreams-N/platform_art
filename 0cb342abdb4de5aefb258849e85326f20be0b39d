We usually stick to just 60 characters in commit message but I'm OK with 76 for reading git log on an 80-column terminal. This one is over 100.

If the new lookup table is better, we should use it instead of the "Index" (rather than in addition to it).

There's a tradeoff. Space for the new lookup table is larger. So I think this is fine - for runtime cases, use the index, otherwise use the lookup table that's oat backed.

Sorry, I don't understand what do you mean: "for runtime cases, use the index, otherwise use the lookup table that's oat backed". In current code lookup table used at runtime.
There are no reasons to build lookup table only for speedup compilation.
Also I notice that lookup table uses less memory then Index and this memory is read only.

This is really sub-optimal. The number of strings is usually an order of magnitude higher than the number of types, so the first binary search is doing about 3 more string comparisons than needed if we provide a "FindTypeId(const char* descriptor)", and it's also bringing non-type strings into cache.

Maybe we should start by improving this slow path and then benchmark against that to assess whether the lookup table (and/or the "Index") is actually needed.
