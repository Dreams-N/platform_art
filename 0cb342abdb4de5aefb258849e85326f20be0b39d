Line too long.

We usually stick to just 60 characters in commit message but I'm OK with 76 for reading git log on an 80-column terminal. This one is over 100.

If the new lookup table is better, we should use it instead of the "Index" (rather than in addition to it).

There's a tradeoff. Space for the new lookup table is larger. So I think this is fine - for runtime cases, use the index, otherwise use the lookup table that's oat backed.

Sorry, I don't understand what do you mean: "for runtime cases, use the index, otherwise use the lookup table that's oat backed". In current code lookup table used at runtime.
There are no reasons to build lookup table only for speedup compilation.
Also I notice that lookup table uses less memory then Index and this memory is read only.

It doesn't really use more memory, especially on 64bit. On 32 bit it is probably similar space usage depending on load factor vs rounding up to nearest power of 2.

If the lookup table really takes less memory than the Index, and if it performs at least comparably to the Index, we should use it instead of the Index even if it's not stored in the oat file (i.e. even when we have to build it and the memory is dirty).

Yes, I think the new table is strictly superior to the old index since it has less probing, less comparisons, similar or better memory usage.

I see that the Index has been removed in PS7. But if the benchmarks show that this is much slower when we don't have the lookup table, should we build the lookup table on too many misses as we used to build the Index?

What cases do we not have lookup table currently? No dex2oat? Its probably cheap enough to create the table in the DexFile constructor.

This is really sub-optimal. The number of strings is usually an order of magnitude higher than the number of types, so the first binary search is doing about 3 more string comparisons than needed if we provide a "FindTypeId(const char* descriptor)", and it's also bringing non-type strings into cache.

Maybe we should start by improving this slow path and then benchmark against that to assess whether the lookup table (and/or the "Index") is actually needed.

Nice catch, I just implemented the FindTypeId that binary searches on the string contents. However, based on my measurements this regresses FindClassDef by around 20x (10% total perf time vs 0.5%) compared to the hash table (compile 100k APKs with interpret-only).
