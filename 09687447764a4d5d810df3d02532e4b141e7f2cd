Should we rename this to GetVRegNonReference?

I'm not sure GetVRegNonReference is a good idea because it can return a reference (as a pointer). But yes, we should probably rename it to avoid the confusion. What about GetVRegPrimitive or GetVRegInt?

I'd prefer doing that in a different CL though. There are many references to this method, especially in both intepreters, so having a dedicated CL is probably better for review.
