The opened_dex_files_ vector is intended to be used internally for memory management purposes. It was never intended to be used to query opened dex files from the class linker.

See https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/121451 and the associated bug for reference.

Why does oatdump need to get the dex files through the class linker instead of opening them itself?
