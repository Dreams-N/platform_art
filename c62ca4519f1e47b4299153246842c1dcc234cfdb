I'm not too thrilled with the two types of arrangements we have for these files. boot-arm.art / boot-arm64.art vs arm/boot.art and arm64/boot.art if there's no preopt.

It would be good to be consistent, but this is fine if it unblocks you.

I think there's likely a better way, perhaps:
/system/framework/arm/boot.art
/system/framework/arm64/boot.art
This route was what I discussed with bdc, and it should be a relatively small change to make things consistent with say a directory naming scheme (but I'd prefer that was a different CL). This change unblocks me as it avoids both zygote 32 and 64 assuming /system/framework/boot.art is for them in the dexpreopt case.
