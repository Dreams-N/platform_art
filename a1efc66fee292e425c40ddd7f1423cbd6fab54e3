We do have other static state like this. As long as it's not something that needs destructors, I think it's fine.

Do we verify -j1...?

No. This is best effort, in a sense. If you prefer, I'll use an atomic (I think a lock is overkill).

I think this is confusing (not blaming you, as it looks like it's always been the terminology?). What's the difference between kind and types? Would "failure level" and "failure kind" be more appropriate? "types" is somehow overloaded, especially in a verifier setup...

I'm worried of renaming things now, as this will make it a non-local change, impacting class-linker, compiler, and tests. Let me file a cleanup bug and do this in a follow-up?
