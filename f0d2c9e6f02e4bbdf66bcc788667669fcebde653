Let's not use the suffix "Pair" here.  If you need to distinguish this from a 32-bit div zero check, use "Wide" instead.  On 32-bit systems, we use a pair of registers to hold a long - but on a 64-bit system it will be a single register.   With very little change, I believe this routine can be used for both 32 & 64 bit systems, so let's try to avoid using 32-bit specific names.

Maybe a comment here would help the reader distinguish the difference between the two GenDivZeroCheck() overloads
