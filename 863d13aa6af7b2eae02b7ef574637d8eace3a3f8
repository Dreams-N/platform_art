According to Intel's documentation, this seems to be wrong.  Only SFENCE or MFENCE are claimed to work here.  See the (rather vague) MOVNTI documentation.

I'm inclined to believe the documentation, since this is my current best theory as to why MFENCE is slower.

I missed this the last time around.

This CL gets this right elsewhere.  And this looks like it's unused code anyway.

An SFENCE or MFENCE is needed after MOVNTI.  That is a special case that avoids the caches. For Java semantics, the locked add (and strong memory model) do the right thing.  In any case, I expect the Quick compiler will be deprecated.
