this code for ARM, ARM64 and MIPS is identical except for the thread register which can be computed from TargetReg(kSelf), remove the duplication by placing in Mir2Lir and overriding on x86?

ARM64 is a bit different, it allocates wide temps and uses card table offset for 8-byte pointers. (There's also the TODO comment and As32BitReg() which seem unnecessary.)

I'll keep this as is for the moment.
