At least the comment needs addressing here. I'm reluctant to set up these fields because at compile time they are meaningless, hence the description of why there was a "hack" for generic JNI. I'd add a "if (!IsCompiler())"  here so we keep our defensive programming for the dex2oat case.

I think there's a TODO here for the interpret-only case. You can better explain why dex2oat will/won't work.
