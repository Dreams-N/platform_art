Why do we even open these dex files here? Doesn't the Runtime open their copies from the boot image when we compile an app? Shouldn't we use those copies instead? Those copies should have the correct location.

(If we expect some extra class path dex files in addition to those in the boot image, we should still try and use those we can find in the boot image.)
