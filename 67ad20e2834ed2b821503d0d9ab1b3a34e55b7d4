I feel that this is still not a very good comment. If we ever decide to go with addressing into the image (why go through the dex cache if you know where the class is?), then things may go wrong.

Don't know what a good comment (or even CHECK) would be here, though.

I still think that is sort of a separate issue, whether or not to support app code to app image dependencies.
