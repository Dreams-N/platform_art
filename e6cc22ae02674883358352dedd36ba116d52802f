Not fully sure whether the enum is the best approach here. It means that you'll have to include nodes.h everywhere you use the third part of the instrinsic_list.h macro. That seems mostly fine, but you never know. Personally I'd think true/false is just fine (especially since you chose bool for the field).

I think having an enum makes the code more readable, especially in the intrinsics_list.h file. It is also reasonable to assume that nodes.h would be included in files that use the third part of the intrinsics_list.h macro, since this is where HInvoke is declared.

You'll have to change this. Either use a boolean here, or make the field of enum type.
