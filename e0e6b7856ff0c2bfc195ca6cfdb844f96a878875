gentlemen, any feedback on the questions in this CL

making a unit test exposed a few inaccuracies in the current code, and getting some clarification would be helpful

So this falls back to what the result of Merge(Invalid, Errournous) should be. Right?

It is not "wrong" from the algorithm point of view to return errornous here since Invalid stands for "no information yet".

However, these are all sketchy cases for sound reasoning.

What I propose, and Nicolas also mentioned is to *not* allow a errornous ReferenceTypeInfo to be created.

we should DCHECK in RTI::Create() that the class handle is valid.

The caller should make sure that if the handle is not ok it falls back to the inexact object type. We could employ a helper for that if there are too many places to check but I don't think so.

Yeah, not allowing is what I'd prefer. Sorry if that wasn't clear.

The string type can never be inexact. The class is final and we have a DCHECK that final classes get to be exact.

Great, then I replace this with imprecise Object, so at least we go through that part of the code (using is_exact from original definition, and then returning in equals branch).

Thanks for clarifying.
