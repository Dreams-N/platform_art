Could this be wrapped in a ifndef ART_TARGET_FRAME_SIZE_LIMIT to allow for configuration via cmd line? i.e. export ART_TARGET_FRAME_SIZE_LIMIT=10624

We try not to do that for important values. What's a good reason for having this configurable at the command line?

Basically convenience. When I'm writing up how to configure a build to use asan/coverage, it's easier to say "address this issue by setting ART_TARGET_SIZE_LIMIT" than "modify this makefile in this way" It's not a showstopper, but is easier to explain when building multiple targets that may/may not have this issue in the future.

But that way the necessary changes aren't written down/codified if you forget, and the next person has to derive them again. (Wouldn't be an issue if we had enough builds for all the configs, so that the build bot would tell you you forgot to do this...)

I'll merge as-is, to keep it a simple refactor without real behavioral changes. Feel free to upload a CL changing the := to a ?= above, and we can discuss on that CL...:-)
