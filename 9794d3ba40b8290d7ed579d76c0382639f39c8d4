You really need to comment on why these are different. Namely that image_begin_ is the 'logical' address where the image will be loaded at runtime. but image_->Begin() is the address where the image is loaded as it is being written (ie now).

comment on what it does.

Also why even have this here? It uses nothing from dex_cache and is only used in patchoat (i think). Why not put it there?

Alternatively why not put it with GcRoot?
