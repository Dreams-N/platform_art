According to Serguei Katkov's latest evaluation, the logic for main thread on target (x86/x86_64) should be the same as for host.
i.e. running_on_host = is_main_stack;

It looks like you need this change not only for host but for target as well. When I set running_on_host equal to true I can boot to GUI. Also if you clean this method body and leave only read from marker and write to it, BTG will crash at reading of marker.
