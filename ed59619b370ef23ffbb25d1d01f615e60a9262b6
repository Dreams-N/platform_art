This should be const.
If you need to modify it we should consider going back to pointers. I don't think the style guide covers this, or at least I didn't find anything, but returning a non const reference is error prone imo.

Same in the others parts.

I know this was Nicolas' suggestion :)

I think we'd be better without the *Expensive* prefix though. Documenting the complexity and the expensiveness is much better imo. In general, expensive does not tell much: space, time, how much? and it creates an easy to copy precedent which is pretty vague.

I just don't want this method to be used. ComputeNumberOfUses does not express this, any other ideas?

Something like LinearTimeNumberOfUses would be more descriptive.  What do you think?
