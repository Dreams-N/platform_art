was this the signedness difference you were talking about? when Android, the Linux kernel, glibc, the BSDs, and elfutils all agree, i think llvm is wrong even if they're right :-) in this case, i assume it's an incorrect assumption on their part about the default signedness of enums.

no the above is becasuse the compiler was complaining about unsigned vs signed with the ternary operator.

No the original issue was the Elf32_Sword vs Elf32_Word change in https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/97640/3/compiler/elf_writer_quick.h

linux elf.h says  Elf32_Sword d_val;
LLVM elf.h says Elf32_Word d_val;
elfutils says Elf32_Word d_val 
http://www.sco.com/developers/gabi/latest/ch5.dynamic.html says Elf32_Word	d_val;

so linux and therefore bionic seems wrong.

yeah, glibc agrees.
