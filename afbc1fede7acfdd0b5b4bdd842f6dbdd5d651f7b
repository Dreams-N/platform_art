I'm averse to switches with default - I like the compiler complaining if you miss an enum case. But you'd have to put it into its own function, as there's code after this...

Here, the default actually covers the VOID case. We read a byte for the type tag from the debugger. It *should* match an enum value. However, in the case we receive garbage (from a bad debugger?), we need to cover our back.

At least here you could easily rewrite this by pulling in the return.
