I don't know. Maybe we should consider turning those into error messages instead of FATALing out. In IsDexOptNeeded we can throw an exception directly, and in ClassLinker not being able to generate an oat file is already an error condition.

i think this is better than where we are now...

i think Richard was going to look at extremely short cases too (see his other tests) which might address this they way you want.

In my oat file management change, for patch set 5, I'm turning these into error messages and handling them appropriately (https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/119862/).
