Can we remove this? Its only useful for the ARM vs Thumb2 case, and we care about that as thumb2 has a +1 in the low-bit of its PC. I worry we'll confuse ISA and standard ISA. Explicitly comparing both ARM and Thumb2 is less error prone as it means we need to handle the +1 difference everywhere when appropriate.

how does this differ from the default with --prebuild? Presumably there are 4 combinations here:
 (prebuild or no) x (relocate or no)
Here we have 3 combinations and the default is somewhat grey.
