Would it make sense to replace this with

if (concurrent_gc_) { .. }

and get rid of AllocatorHasConcurrentGC() ?

Using concurrent_gc_ is good for now, but eventually I want to constant fold out the if statement. This is not currently possible due to the allocator type possibly the large object one. I know how to fix this issue and will do it in a future performance CL.
