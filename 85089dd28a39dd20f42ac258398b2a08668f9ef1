How does this work if rl_arg is in an XMM register on x86?  There won't be a matching view.  You have to generate code to get the high word into the low word of an XMM register or a GPR.

In the current soft-float convention, rl_arg will not be an xmm register at this point (all arguments are passed via core registers).  In the upcoming hard-float convention we will no longer split long and double arguments across registers and frame.  Any long/double argument that doesn't fit entirely in register will be passed entirely in the frame.  So, we won't need to try to pull out the high-order word.
