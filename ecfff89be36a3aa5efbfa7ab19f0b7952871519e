Out of curiosity, is it used anywhere? FYI, I implemented

  bool operator==(const DexRegisterLocation& other_location) {
    return kind_ == other_location.kind_ && value_ == other_location.value_;
  }

in https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/142375/, as I needed it to implement art::GrowableArray<T>::Find in https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/142375/1/compiler/utils/growable_array.h.  We should probably merge them. :)

I know. I was thinking that we would merge this first and thus I added the common parts here. I also need it and as far as I know operator overloading is not encouraged by the style. We should use a function.
