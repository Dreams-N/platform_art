Doesn't make sense, why does VRegA return InstB?

I'm guessing its because the layout is different enough from the rest of the instructions so the same convention can't be reused.

In that case it would just be more clearer to inline the contents of InstB here

It would be really good to document this in the dex instruction files instead of just in the test.

Also, where is the H?
