since the class is local only now (nice!), I would suggest to put it in an anonymous namespace.

That really isn't consistent with other classes defined in .cc files.  I don't see any benefit to putting it into an anonymous class, and like the fact that the class name has 'x86' in it if printed anywhere.

I think we are fine leaving it in x86 namespace. It's consistent with all the other similar cases.
