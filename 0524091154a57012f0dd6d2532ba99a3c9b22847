Expand the documentation here, tell that you eliminate hard errors and allow the fuzzer to move on when it can't mutate.

I think we're good here. It will be hard to keep in the 120 limit and keep readability.

I will make this throw exceptions and ignore them on the caller site based on their type. If the file is not found for example maybe we should actually abort?

If I understand correctly, the intention is that you want to always keep going if there is a problem when mutating an input file. If so, then there are a number of other errorAndQuit calls in here that will also need to be replaced with exception throwing.

These exceptions should be thrown all the way out of codeItemToMutatableCode() and mutatableCodeToCodeItem(), back to the Program class, which should then mark itself as invalid, and you can check if the Program is invalidly mutated in the places where you currently check if your received program is null? (Fuzzer.fuzz(), etc)

I'd say this is still an IllegalArgumentException.
