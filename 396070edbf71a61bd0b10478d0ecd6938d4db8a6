This has gone way beyond my comments on PS4 in automatically supporting 32-bit variants on 64-bit architectures. That's OK for make files but don't do that in the C++ code where we should rigorously follow the ART_ENABLE_CODEGEN_<arch> defines.

I commented on all the places where I wanted to see some change, i.e. the x86 and mips bits that required it because they share the backend for 32-bit and 64-bit variants.

Please revert all the extra changes between PS4 and PS5.

As I've suggested on PS4, this should really be conditional on ART_ENABLE_CODEGEN_mips. Do not force all mips64 devices to support mips32.
