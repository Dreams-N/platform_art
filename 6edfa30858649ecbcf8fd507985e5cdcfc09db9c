We should collect string ids in parallel and then resolve them single-threaded. This would also remove the overhead of changing to runnable and back and looking up the dex cache for each const-string.

Sure, I'll implement that optimization. I wanted something simple for the first iteration (considering you'd need a map of dex file to ordered set, etc).

From an API standpoint, you have to agree, this isn't great. But it was already pretty bad, I give you that :-)

Can we make the thread_pool_ a field of CompilerDriver (most methods take it, so not sure why it wasn't the case before), and change the thread_count argument to "bool deterministic" (in the end that's what it's for).

Well, the parallel thread pool is created late and not stored in a field. But sure, I can push it there.

Why do we need this? (Does GC walk the heap in a different order for different addresses? Does the address contribute to the identity hash?)

There are sets in the compiler (image writer) that have object pointers as keys. I wanted this to be low-impact, so not change it to an ordered set/map. But then the addresses need to be reproduce-able.
