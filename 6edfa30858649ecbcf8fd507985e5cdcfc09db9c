From an API standpoint, you have to agree, this isn't great. But it was already pretty bad, I give you that :-)

Can we make the thread_pool_ a field of CompilerDriver (most methods take it, so not sure why it wasn't the case before), and change the thread_count argument to "bool deterministic" (in the end that's what it's for).
