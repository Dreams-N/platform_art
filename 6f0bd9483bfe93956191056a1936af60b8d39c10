I'd call it UNREACHABLE_..., as that's the name of the macro/attribute in C land.

Could you also maybe not use UNIMPLEMENTED_INTRINSIC and instead use a special version that LOG(FATAL)s? That way it would also act as a guard for the expected behavior.

Renamed to UNREACHABLE and added the FATAL suggestion (I was playing with the latter, but then chickened out; but with backing from you I dare to venture there!)
