I wouldn't expose this, since it's only used internally by SetIntrinsic.

This is pretty crude and I'm not sure it's correct. Wouldn't we potentially GVN volatile gets/sets on unresolved fields?

Please see Nicolas' feedback earlier. GVN/LICM do all the right tests, and the CanBeMoved() really has another meaning (it could even be true now, but this is more efficient.

I don't disagree with Nicolas' comment but we currently don't have another way of marking an instruction volatile (viz. StaticFieldGet and InstanceFieldGet). Is that the reason why you are giving all Unsafe operations kAllSideEffects? That does get around the problem but it is pretty misleading.

As you mentioned in your email, we can discuss these later and perhaps make changes. For this CL, let's switch these CHECK-DAGs to CHECK so as to enforce a line ordering.
