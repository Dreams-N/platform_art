Just FYI, I have added similar code to BCE to make sure all information is updated correctly. Note that BCE *also* needs to be careful generating code in the preheader if that preheader is a TryBoundary. For now, I just disable BCE in those cases (so you can get the other CL in as well), but in the long run we want to handle those cases too probably.
