Not sure if it matters, but the above two visitor calls use kRootNativeStack, as opposed to kRootVMInternal. Is this as intended?

Also, just in case, is there anything else in tlsPtr_ that might need to be visited as a root?

I guess kRootNativeStack would be a better fit. It doesn't really matter that much though. I don't see anything else in tlsPtr_ that needs to be a root.
