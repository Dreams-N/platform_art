It's actually 4.1 and later, not 4 and later (line 360).

I only wanted to raise this issue because I'm not sure what our buildbot servers are running, it would be good to avoid another python3-type of problem.

As far as I know nobody is trying to support running art on mac os x anymore..

Usually people just hardcode the FD on older bashes, e.g. 9 and 10.

Anyway my point is the {fd} syntax doesn't work period on <4.1 versions, so for example line 382 is still broken on older bashes.
