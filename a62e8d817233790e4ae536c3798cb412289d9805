Comments to say when this is used. Final?

Code like this makes me wish for greater use of namespaces. Having something called art::MemoryAllocator could clearly have a meaning in the runtime. The runtime's allocators are buried in art::gc:allocator::... so as a random person you may well come across this code first and think its to do with the garbage collector.

Added a comment + FINAL. Also renamed the class to be less generic.

I like keeping things under the same namespace, avoiding annoying resolution errors. So for cases that are purely about avoiding polluting the same namespace (unlike mirror::), I prefer making sure things have different names.

Some times the resolution error is an indication you aren't doing what you thought. As with mirror its a tool to stop people from hitting their fingers - or to make it clear when they intend to. Kind of a mute point here as the class doesn't have scope beyond the .cc file, but from the Doxygen view of the code perhaps its relevant.

Maybe add a TODO to support spill masks ?

Longer-term the spill masks should be taken out of here, they are only relevant for the quick compiler and imply a register allocation that is fixed for the life-time of a method. A comment to explain what the values of magic constants means is always useful.
