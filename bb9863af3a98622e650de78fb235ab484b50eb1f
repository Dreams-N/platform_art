Maybe add

  CHECK(!Is32BitFPU())

here?

mfhc1/mthc1 can be used with 32-bit FPUs, but only on R2+ as these instructions appeared first in R2. If anything, we could add a check for R2+. But if we want to introduce/tighten up all such checks, we should probably have a separate patch for that. Right now, if possible, I'd prefer this go in as-is so we can unblock Chris Larsen's MIPS32 intrinsics work (his outstanding patches have become stale because of this and other recent changes and I promised to get my changes in ASAP). Please?
