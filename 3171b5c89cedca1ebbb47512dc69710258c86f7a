Out of curiosity, did this code have clients? (I guess not.)

So the load and the store replaced by this DCHECK were not (or no longer) useful?

looking at this:
- the destination is a double stack location
- the source is a quickParam: (reg + stack slot)
- movl will only move one word (the register)

Don't you need to move the stack part as well?

The DCHECK below checks that the quick parameter stack location is the same as the destination. That's because the only case we can have such a move is when moving a quick parameter location to its stack slot, and the caller has already put the high part in the stack slot.
