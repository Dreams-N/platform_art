I've done my best to guarantee forward progress during graph coloring, so we wouldn't need an NDEBUG limit here. Still, is there a compiler timeout, just in case?

This is a fairly important TODO, since being too conservative here can mean spilling too many callee-save registers at the beginning of a function.

As I mentioned, some of the code in this method (and the methods it calls) is adapted from the linear scan allocator. Ideally, the register allocator base class could become a driver class that does this setup before calling into a subclass, but some details are too implementation-specific right now, and I hesitate to further refactor linear scan for the sake of graph coloring. Let me know what you think.

Is there a cleaner way to check that we are at the end of the block? Is (position + 1) the correct place to split when at the end of a block?

Is it true that this needs to be special-cased, or are the live intervals such that this constraint will automatically be represented in the interference graph?
