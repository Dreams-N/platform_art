I'm playing with something similar to this (a separate task).  Under heavy load, for a small enough program, it is possible for shutdown to have started before RunProfileSaverThread executes.  In this case AttachThread will give an error message and return nullptr, which fails this CHECK.  I have a workaround that I can provide, but I would appreciate any comments.

I guess there is a small window in which this can fail. Maybe a CHECK is unnecessary here. 

Thanks for pointing this out.
