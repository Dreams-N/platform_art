No way to test both?

The CFI test does test both variants (compressed and uncompressed).  One has full signatures, and the other does not.  Therefore this code just checks method name (by looking for substring) and ignores the parameters.
I am happy with it since the purpose of the CFI test is to check that we can unwind and that we see the methods in the backtrack.  It does not need to worry how the parameters are pretty printed by the utility.

Sure? How are you testing that one path in your code prints the signature, and the other doesn't?

Do I want to test that?  We might easily change our mind and decide to always include the signature or never do.  Either way, this test will check we can still unwind.

How else are you validating that the code you just wrote works?

I know it still produces it still produces the right method names, and right CFI for unwinding.
However, I do not check that the parameters are absent. (other than verifying manually of course)  I am still not sure I want do that check in this test.
Any suggestion how this CL (and the other one) should be tested?  The only thing I can think of is to actually test the size of the compressed data and check is it smaller then given bound.

Since you control how this test is being run, you could pass a flag to the Main class, and use that flag to check here with and without signatures.
