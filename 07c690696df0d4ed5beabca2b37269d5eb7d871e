Did you check the code to make sure this assert is true
(1) offset == 0 seems indeed impossible, although you have to chase through the parseXXX methods for that
(2) can offset be the old length (in that case one could skip this step).
Probably neither, but perhaps put that in the comment if you checked it.

I inferred it to be reasonable, given the rest of the code, but superfluous anyway (new char[0] returns something sane, and growing would be OK also).  Removed.
