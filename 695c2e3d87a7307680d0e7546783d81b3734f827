I'd remove the last sentence. If you want one, then "the fewer suspend checks, the better for the SSA builder" or something like that helps to better understand why. And/or you can also mention that dx is generating branches to the first return encountered.

Yep, I've already changed it to something shorter. This version is also wrong - I didn't realize it doesn't produce a SuspendCheck for spin locks (target_offset == 0)

This is probably computed before calling Add SuspendCheck. How about passing it to this method?

Could do, it's just a bit messy because the callers of this method tend to compute the target a lot later after calling this. But yeah, why not
