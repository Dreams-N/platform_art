I don't know what the gt_bias is but shouldn't this be kCondGlt? It looks really inconsistent with the rest.

The floating point compare has a less-than or greater-than variant, the only difference being what the behavior is for unordered results (e.g. NaN < 0.0 is true for the less-than flavor and false for the greater-than flavor). gt_bias is reflecting which variant of the compare opcode is being used, but the code/names could certainly be more intention revealing.
