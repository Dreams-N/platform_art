I guess nothing was trying to bit_cast to a smaller type? The base/casts.h seems to only let you use equivalently-sized types.

Indeed.  I haven't found any use case of this version of bit_cast trying to convert to a smaller type.  There were occurrences of conversions to a larger type in runtime/entrypoints/quick/quick_trampoline_entrypoints.cc though, where I used a static_cast in addition to bit_cast:

* https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/143613/1/runtime/entrypoints/quick/quick_trampoline_entrypoints.cc@1277

All other uses were between same-size types.
