A more common style is to name this like a constexpr: kBufferSize.

This is after the fact and means:

 1) You oversize the buffer.
 2) It may break before ever getting here.

Consider having DCHECKs before ptr_ is updated. Probably you should make conservative checks for all the ULEB stuff.

My intent is to have some confidence the released version will not crash because the expression is one byte over the allocated space due to some corner case which does not generally happen.

Another option is use growable buffer instead.
