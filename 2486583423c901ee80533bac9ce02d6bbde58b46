Note: this specification is wrong now.

With the move to OpenJDK (basically just catching up), the definition of round() changed.

See, for example, https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html#round(double), or our run-test 082.

(If you pass that one, I'm surprised, and very interested in how your Floor works...)
