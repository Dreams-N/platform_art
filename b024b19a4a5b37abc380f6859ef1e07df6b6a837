Actually I think we don't need this anymore.

During the instruction simplification we don't remove any instruction that could alter the precision of the nullability information.

So it should be enough to do 

check_cast->SetMustDoNullCheck(check_cast->InputAt(0)->CanBeNull());

in VisitCheckCast.

(simillar for instanceof).

Let me know what you think, or if I miss a case.
