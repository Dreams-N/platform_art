if /data/local/tmp is always available now and writable by shell user, maybe we should always just use that? /sdcard predates that...

It's part of /data and has been on every device I've seen. Data is rw, and so as root we can write then. I don't know about a non-root user, though. Is there anywhere a shell user can arbitrarily write to?

I would prefer to keep the old behavior, just as a safety measure, I think.
