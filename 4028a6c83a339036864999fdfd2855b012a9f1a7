This isn't good :) I just spent hours to track this down after a rebase. Let's minimize/centralize the places where we put hard-coded offsets like these. I think including asm_support.h would suffice.

Agreed, if we define constants there needs to be asserts in unit tests and the likes. My preference here would be to use mirror::String::CountOffset(), etc. Originally these constants were in the x86 assembler constants and had asserts in the x86 thread code (iirc).
