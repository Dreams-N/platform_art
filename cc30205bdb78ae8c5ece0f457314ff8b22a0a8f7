If you are re-factoring this what about adding oat_method.GetCodeOffset() to GetNativePcOffset() ? 

IMHO, this should make it easier to associate a native pc to the stack map's native_pc_offset since there would be no need to add the method's code_offset.

I have a patch in my tree that does this. I was planning to push it together with the slowpath sharing work.
