Make this "int a" to reduce the number of implicit conversions - we're not testing those.

What are you actually testing here? That the byte-to-int conversion is implicit and as such doesn't contribute to Arm64DataProcWithShifterOp?

Why doesn't this generate a Arm64DataProcWithShifterOp? I would expect one of the int-to-long conversions to be folded into the add-long.

Also, I would expect that you actually want to test the folding of int-to-long into the add-long and it would remove unnecessary clutter if the parameter "a" was "long a" and the assertion was assertLongEquals(), allowing CHECK-NOT: TypeConversion.
