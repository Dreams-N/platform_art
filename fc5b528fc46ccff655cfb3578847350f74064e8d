My intuition of the "main" space is what is always non-null (the only free list space prezygote and the free list space that occupies the space right after the zygote space.) But this "main_space_" follows this sense only post-zygote fork as what you needed is a way to tell if an object is movable or not and is null pre-zygote fork. Just a side note.
