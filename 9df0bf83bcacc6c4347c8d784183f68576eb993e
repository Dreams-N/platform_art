I believe this approach wouldn't be friendly for vectorizer. However, I imagine if we ever want one likely we will implement a vector type and then we can save and restore vector registers.

Maybe object types should be treated a bit more carefully. Namely, don't assume they are 32-bit pointers.

In this case, stack_index_ refers to VRs, so it is okay.  Dex assumes only 32 bit pointers at this time anyways.  The changes for that are more pervasive.

No, this case can't happen, as it is Move64.  I will delete it.
