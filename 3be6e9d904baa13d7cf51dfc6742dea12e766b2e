Is there a reason to touch all this? It seems like a semantically equivalent transformation, and a reason would be nice.

This is to avoid including jdwp/jdwp.h into runtime.h file (which is included almost everywhere already).

Opinions?

You could use a unique_ptr (it works as long as constructor and destructor of Runtime are in the .cc file, which they are). Else I think it's fine.

Alternatively, looking at the debugger, we only allow one per process, it seems, as the interface is static. So you could also store it there as a static member?
