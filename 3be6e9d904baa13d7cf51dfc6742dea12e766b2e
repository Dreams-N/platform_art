Is there a reason to touch all this? It seems like a semantically equivalent transformation, and a reason would be nice.

I changed jdwp_options to a pointer in ParseOption because we modify it and IIRC we agreed on using pointer than reference in that case, right?
For the Parse method, you're right. It's mainly to transform into a foreach loop.

Minor nit: redundant check//you could also use unique_ptr to avoid changing the constructor/destructor

Argh, sorry about this, completely forgot that jdwp_options was a global

This is to avoid including jdwp/jdwp.h into runtime.h file (which is included almost everywhere already).

Opinions?

You could use a unique_ptr (it works as long as constructor and destructor of Runtime are in the .cc file, which they are). Else I think it's fine.

Alternatively, looking at the debugger, we only allow one per process, it seems, as the interface is static. So you could also store it there as a static member?

OK, I'll try the unique_ptr. 

I agree about Dbg class, there's only one. That's in my todo list of a more global refactoring. That could simplify the access to JDWP options when starting the JDWP thread.
