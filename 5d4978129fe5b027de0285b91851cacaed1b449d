The CAS failed, which may be spurious or because of a concurrent change caused by the read barriers. Why is this a failure to deflate and not something to retry in a loop?

I had thought it was ok to fail to deflate as it'd be tried again in the next trim. But it's possible to retry. I changed it back to SetLockWord as we are at a pause here (technically not a pause in the image writer case, but mutators are not running) and won't really have concurrent read barrier state changes.

Thanks, I don't mind the CAS it was more that it wasn't documented in the same way the other "return false" cases were above. If you are assuming no concurrent operations then perhaps a debug assert is appropriate or a comment to something like that.
