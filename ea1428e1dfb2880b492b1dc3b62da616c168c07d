In theory I can see the boolean simplifier enabling inlining for some methods. If it happens it's probably not a representative number so I think this change is good.

Thoughts?

The number of blocks does not matter any more for inlining, or does it? That's the reason why I've put it here and not into the inliner.

I'm just thinking that we really should run the inliner as early as possible. The conditions for inlining have changed and running fold/inst_simp separately on the inner method does not help any more. On the contrary, running them on the entire graph would be beneficial.
