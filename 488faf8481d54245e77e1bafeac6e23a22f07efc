Can you fix these too? Sorry, that somehow slipped past me in the previous CL.

This is not right because it tests the NOT:Or after the matched BoolNot which is just before Return. Either split this into two CHECK-STARTs - one BoolNot vs. zero Ors - or get rid of it entirely because you've shown the Or is not part of the data-flow leading to the Return.

I splitted it.

But wouldn't that be correct when the new IRs are inserted before the original Or? If the Or wasn't deleted we could have

    And
    BooleanNot
    Or
    Return [<<BooleanNot>>]
