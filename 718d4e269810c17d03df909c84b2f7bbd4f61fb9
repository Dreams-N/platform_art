(Already commented in person) Removing this garbage-writing code may be a right fix for the race condition. But are there any other error cases that this code intended to detect which would become undetectable if we remove this code? If there's a synchronization that would avoid this race condition, it might be better, but I am not sure what the synchronization is.
