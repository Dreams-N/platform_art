How about an enum for this.  I don't like the hardcoded value. HSelect::kSelectConditionIndex?

Me neither but this is certainly not the only place where we hardcode input indices. What I could do in this particular case is:

  !(user->IsSelect() && user->AsSelect()->GetCondition() == condition)

But that's only possible because `condition` has just one use in this branch.
