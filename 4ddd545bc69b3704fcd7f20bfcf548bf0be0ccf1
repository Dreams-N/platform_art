This looks pretty ugly. I think it's better to define a module for this and rely on the target sync rule to do this.

I have recently started getting familiar with the build system internals, so I am not sure if I have understood you correctly: As far I can see, the test-art-target-sync rule depends on the TEST_ART_TARGET_SYNC_DEPS variable, so I can adjust it, and then let the rule do its job. Is that what you meant?

The variable only describe the dependencies, but the rule does a simple general sync. As such, you also must install the file into $OUT/data.
