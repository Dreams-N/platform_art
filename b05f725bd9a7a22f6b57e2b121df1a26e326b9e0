This is a bit different with the original code, and it is better since it avoids duplicated copy.

But I think the correct algorithm should be :
  first_after_last_mapped_in += adjust;
  regs_left_to_pass_via_stack -= adjust;
  regs_left_to_pass_via_stack = GenDalvikArgsBulkCopy(info, first_after_last_mapped_in, regs_left_to_pass_via_stack);

Otherwise, first_after_last_mapped_in + regs_left_to_pass_via_stack will be wrong which is used by the below loop which handles the stack arguments. But maybe we need to find a better name for first_after_last_mapped_in, for example, stack_map_start.
