As bdc mentioned, it does seem like overkill. But I guess it's the easiest way to get this done.

I wonder whether a full stack is better, though. If symbols are stripped from the library, the unwind info will be useless.

I wonder if this would be too spammy, maybe we want to only print this the first few times it happens.

That would require tracking the location, though, else you'd deduplicate non-duplicates.

I feel that if you run with checkjni, you want that info, and we should KISS.
