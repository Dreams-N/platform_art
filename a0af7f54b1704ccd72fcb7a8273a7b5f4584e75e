Previously, we would have called the wrong method, right? So, my vote goes to ThrowNoSuchMethodError(). We would not break anything that was previously working correctly.

If you think it's too radical for backward compatibility, check the dex file version and if it's >= 37, ThrowNoSuchmethodError(). If someone changes tools to generate version 37 and doesn't test that their app still works, it's their problem. (Though this approach will complicate the test.)
