That's the value thumb_opcode should have depending on whether we want an add or a sub, with or without flags, as shown is the table below.

I see... so you're basically spell out what's in the if-else sequence below. I don't think it adds any value as it is.

The if used to switch to T4 enconding as far as I can tell, but now you're adding an extra condition and go back to T3. I think we should try to push that part to the switch case above. (Is this the same thing you asked Andreas?)
