It seems much better to start scanning where we left off the last time, or even at a pseudo-random place, and wrap around at the end of the last allocated chunk.  The current approach is likely to spend a lot of time scanning the beginning of the bit vector if we ever end up with a significant number of inflated monitors.

This probably rarely happens, so the risk here is a nasty performance anomaly rather than bad behavior on typical benchmarks.

Rule of thumb:  Never use any variant of first-fit allocation.

evidence we should be overloading new and delete?
