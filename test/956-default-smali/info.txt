Smali-based tests for experimental interface default methods.

Obviously needs to run under ART.

The file smali/Main.smali was generated using the ./util-src/generate_smali.py
script. ./expected.txt was generated by using the ./util-src/generate_java.sh
script to extract the embedded java reference implementation from the generated
smali files then the extracted java code was compiled and run using another java
implementation. The ./util-src/generate_smali.py script uses the
./smali/classes.json file to create the Main.smali file. The generated file will
call every method of every class in every allowed manner and print the results.
Note that currently all tested functions must take no arguments and return a
String.  Add any new classes or interfaces to this file and re-run the script to
add functionality to this test.

To update the test files do the following steps:
    <Add new classes/interfaces>
    <Add these classes/interfaces to ./smali/classes.json>
    ./util-src/generate_smali.py smali > smali/Main.smali
    mkdir tmp
    ./util-src/generate_java.sh smali tmp
    pushd tmp
    javac Main.java
    java Main > ../expected.txt
    popd
    rm -rf tmp
    git add ./smali/classes.json ./smali/Main.smali ./expected.txt
