Smali-based tests for experimental interface default methods.

This tests that interface method resolution order is correct.

Obviously needs to run under ART or a java-8 runtime and compiler.

When run smali test files are generated by the util-src/generate_smali.py
script.  If we run with --jvm we will use the util-src/generate_java.sh script
to turn the smali into equivalent java using the embedded java code.

Care should be taken when updating the generate_smali.py script. It must always
return equivalent output when run multiple times.

To update the expected.txt run
    JAVA_HOME="/path/to/java-8-jdk" ../run-test --update --use-java-home --host --jvm 957-default-iface-resolution-smali
