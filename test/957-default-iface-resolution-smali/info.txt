Smali-based tests for experimental interface default methods.

This tests that interface method resolution order is correct.

Obviously needs to run under ART.

The test files under ./smali/ were generated by the ./util-src/generate_smali.py
script. ./expected.txt was generated by using the ./util-src/generate_java.sh
program to extract the embedded java reference implementation from the generated
smali files then the extracted java code was compiled and run using another java
implementation.

To re-create the test files do the following steps:
    rm -f ./smali/*
    ./util-src/generate_smali.py smali
    mkdir tmp
    ./util-src/generate_java.sh smali tmp
    pushd tmp
    javac Main.java
    java Main > ../expected.txt
    popd
    rm -rf tmp
