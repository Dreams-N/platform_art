we usually just LOG(FATAL), if dumping this way is preferred (rather than LOG(FATAL) << exc->Dump();) should we put something into logging?

The issue that I was trying to solve is the cut-off in the log. As far as I was told, the logger doesn't differentiate between multi-line log messages, and cuts everything simply at a certain length. So this is trying to log each line separately.
