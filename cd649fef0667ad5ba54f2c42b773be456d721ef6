I don't think it's correct. I just hit this check during a new JDWP test I'm writing. The resolution trampoline, as its name implies, not only deals with static method for class initialization: it is also used to resolve method on first access.

I think we should just do the same in that case and check whether we need to force interpreter once the method is resolved.
