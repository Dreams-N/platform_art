Would it be cleaner to do that check in the caller instead? It looks like only the debugger could lead to this situation.

Agreed. You could rename this method to UpdateMethodsCodeImpl and have two callers: one for the normal flow (UpdateMethodsCode) and one for the debugger (UpdateMethodsCodeForDebugger). Then you can move each check to its appropriate caller.

Does that sound reasonable?
