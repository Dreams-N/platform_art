Seriously dislike this now. This makes it impossible (or at least really, really painful) to use a visualizer as a temporary tool while debugging issues for anything that doesn't fit in the global one - e.g., inlining decisions.

Can we change this to a pointer and just abort if we'd have to consult it when initialized with nullptr?

Sure, but could you give a more concrete example of how this is painful?

Perhaps a more descriptive name would be better here - this describes the type of the variable, not its intended use.
