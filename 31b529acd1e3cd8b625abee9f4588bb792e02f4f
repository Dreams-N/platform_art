Rather than potentially running RTP for every Invoke, could you signal to the main inliner method that it should run RTP at the end?

Yeah I was wondering about it myself. Since other places in this file where we inline also run rtp for every inlined invoke, i'll consider it in a follow-up.

It brings you better type info, but since it's expensive we could avoid it.

Historical context:
- I initially did it after each invoke because we need to fix some type assumptions. That was scrapped due to complexity and unclear benefits, but I never move the pass to the top level.
