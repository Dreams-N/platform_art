Okay, no reason why we couldn't support this. We assumed single-level inlining should be enough and added the DCHECKs to warn ourselves if that didn't hold any more. Let me clean this up for you though.

I don't get this... 

  user->InputAt(index) == current

  current->IsEmittedAtUseSite()

So this will always skip the DCHECK.
