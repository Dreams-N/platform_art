Okay, no reason why we couldn't support this. We assumed single-level inlining should be enough and added the DCHECKs to warn ourselves if that didn't hold any more. Let me clean this up for you though.

Should I am assume that you will merge 200352 first, and then I will rebase on top?  Or do you just want me to rebase on top of it before you merge?

I don't get this... 

  user->InputAt(index) == current

and you know that

  current->IsEmittedAtUseSite()

So this will always skip the DCHECK.

I was just getting this to work, and figured that more DCHECKs were better :-)
