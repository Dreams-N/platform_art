Not your comment, but I don't understand this. Why is the stack not mapped? The comment leads to believe we are calling this method twice, which sounds wrong.

maybe "the main thread's stack" would help?

or is the problem that it's not widely known that the main thread's stack is mapped in on-demand? (in which case "the main thread's stack is not _yet_ mapped _because it's mapped in on-demand_)."

Why do we we need to map in the stack? Please add a comment.
