Does this part need to be fixed? It seems to split up the long...

Your call. This is setting the low value in the register, but the whole low/high will still be in stack.

Do you prefer having garbage in the register?

I did that first, but the code in this file is generic and when telling which index it is, you don't know whether the register is odd or even.

I also would prefer to call it something like kAlignPairRegister. If you don't think that's confusing I'll go with it.
