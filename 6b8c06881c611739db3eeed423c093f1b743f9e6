Does this part need to be fixed? It seems to split up the long...

Your call. This is setting the low value in the register, but the whole low/high will still be in stack.

Do you prefer having garbage in the register?

No, it's fine with me if it works. One could argue it's superfluous work, and a -1 in the condition wouldn't write to the stack, but I don't care.

I don't follow: -1?

You could alternatively call it what it is: align long pairs.

I did that first, but the code in this file is generic and when telling which index it is, you don't know whether the register is odd or even.

I also would prefer to call it something like kAlignPairRegister. If you don't think that's confusing I'll go with it.

I don't understand the end of the first sentence. Isn't gpr_index_ the index?

Not necessarily. It depends on where you start: from R1 for regular Java parameters, or R0, for all parameters including the method.

In this file, we apparently assume we start with the former.
