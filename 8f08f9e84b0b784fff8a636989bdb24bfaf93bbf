should these be EXPECTs or ASSERTs ? If the initial condition to PerformLICM didn't hold, then there's no point proceeding is there ?

Personally I prefer to use ASSERT only when the successive code would crash if the assert failed, or if every single EXPECT afterwards would also fail.

That being said I'm not too sure on what's actually going on here. Can these EXPECTs fail independently?

I used ASSERT above (if the SSA phase fails, no point proceeding). But I deliberately chose EXPECT (well CHECK originally :-) here since if a statement is at the wrong place, we can still proceed and find if more statements are at the wrong place....
