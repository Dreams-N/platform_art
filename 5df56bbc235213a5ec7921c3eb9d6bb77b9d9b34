SUSPEND_CHECK_INTERVAL was set 1000. A "mov" then worked fine. Now that SUSPEND_CHECK_INTERVAL is 997, a literal pool load is needed. Note that this line does not appear inside a "#ifdef ARM_R4_SUSPEND_FLAG...#endif". Changing 1000 to 997 thus causes a compilation error.

This update was made for consistency, to make sure that - in the case ARM_R4_SUSPEND_FLAG is defined - we wouldn't encounter a compilation error.
