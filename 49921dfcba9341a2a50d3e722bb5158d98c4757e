I'd prefer something more ala:

if (..InterpreteOnly()) return false;
if (JitAtFirstUse()) return false
return true;

Looks like you could only have one CanUseOATCode?

I don't understand this comment. Can you explain it a bit more?

Do you want me to merge this one whit the one in class_linker.cc (they have pretty different signature)?
Or do you want me to remove line 506 from this file (I think it was added because of the SHARED_REQUIRES)? Or I completely misunderstand what you meant?
