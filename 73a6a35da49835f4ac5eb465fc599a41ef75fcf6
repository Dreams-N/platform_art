Would you please extend the comment a bit, making clear what's redundant and why?

I had to spend a bit of time thinking through this and making sure I understood it (I was concerned we're missing an update and exception traces would be wrong, but now I understand that mterp already wrote the dex pc in).


The following is up for discussion:

Tracing is normally off, anyways. So the TraceExecution is for all intents and purposes a nop, and I don't think it needs to be avoided.

In that case, you can rewrite your

 do {
   if (x) { a }
   ...
 } until (y);
 a;

to be

 if (x) { a }
 do {
   ...
   a;
 } until (y);

That would avoid the branch in the loop. Given, it's a micro-op, and mterp is the future, but still...
