ugh, looks like I should make GetThisObject protected :-)
It seems weird to be assuming where the visitor terminates and be reading it here. Can you cache the value like before?

The thread is suspended by the debugger. The visitor terminates at the frame we're looking for (that's the job of the FindFrameVisitor). Otherwise we return an error.

I can get back to the previous version if doing it that way is a problem. Both visitors has similar functionality, except access 'this' object.
