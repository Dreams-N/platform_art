But don't we have a force_interpreter flag we passed to the interpreter?

Do you mean the stay_in_interpreter flag I introduced or something else? Either way, (1) it does not seem trivial to get that information from there to here and (2) will that be fool proof? just testing that we need or don't need the interpreter when invoking the method does not guarantee we need that here later,does it?

You could avoid doing the call to this method if the flag is set.

We should make it full proof. Flag is set: never leave the interpreter. Flag is not set: we can optimize.
