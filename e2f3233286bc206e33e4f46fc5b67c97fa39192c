I don't think this code handle heap corruption related crashes like:

signal 11 (SIGSEGV), code 2 (SEGV_ACCERR), fault addr 421f54c0

backtrace:
    #00 pc 0000b1c0  /data/dalvik-cache/system@framework@boot.oat
    #01 pc dead431f  <unknown>

These are not null pointer exceptions and should not be treated as such. Please do not submit this until these faults are rejected by the null pointer handler.

How did you generated this crash?  It passed all the checks for being in compiled code, otherwise it wouldn't get here.
