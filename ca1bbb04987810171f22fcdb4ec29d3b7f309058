this seems like a purely stylistic fix that's unrelated to the change in general. I'd move it to a separate change. (same for the ones below)

Happy to split this up if you really insist (and I have asked for this many times myself when a CL really had several components), but just for my own understanding, this is not a cherry pick and we are far from the next release. In  most other groups it was perfectly okay to make some unrelated formatting fixes while working on a file during very active development....
