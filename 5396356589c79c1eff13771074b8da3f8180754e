This feels like a CSE like pass, not sure why we need side data other than to say whether initialization is necessary or not. The pass only being necessary if there are static field accesses.

I was thinking about doing the same as the null check elimination pass, except that the bit field would be indexed by the meta::sfield_annotation. It's much better than using a std::set of field indexes.

I guess we'd need to go a level deeper and extract unique class indexes from the annotated fields. Well, I'll need to think about it a bit more. WIP

WIP: We would insert IGET/IPUT with an already resolved annotation. Currently, if we want to insert an IGET/IPUT (with MIR_CALLEE as in https://android-review.googlesource.com/73710) we'd need to somehow hack around the FastInstance() call in GenIGet()/GenIPut().

If you are speculating like this you can use the start/end assert no thread suspensions methods on Thread. If you hit the assert then you need a handle/SirtRef.
