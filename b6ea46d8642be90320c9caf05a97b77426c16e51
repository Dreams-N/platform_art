How about
1) doing this in the core build system for prebuilt executables,
or 2) setting the executable bit on the source file?

For this module specifically, the executable bit isn't set on the local module since it will only properly run once installed. I'll take a look at doing this generically in prebuilt_internal.mk.

For the other modules, they can run from the source directory, and have their executable bits set already. So I've removed the chmod on those.
