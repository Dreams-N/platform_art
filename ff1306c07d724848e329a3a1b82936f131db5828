For the time being, could we avoid this complexity, and just do 64bits moves?

Ok I'll clean that up now.
Note that this function did not allow generating 32bit moves. It was just necessary to find an appropriate type for the `MoveLocation()` helper. I'll remove it by making the type optional in `MoveLocation()`.

Thanks. What's your opinion on it? Did you get any feedback from other teams?
