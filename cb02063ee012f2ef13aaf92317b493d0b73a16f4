In a JIT context this should never be the case. Maybe DCHECK it?

I think we can improve the design here and it's worth a discussion.

Getting the profiling_info from the ArtMethod will only work for JIT. Whereas this codepath is also used for AOT.

I don't have a strong suggestion right now but we could consider passing down this info from the top level.

Short term, we could also guard this around a more explicit IsJit().

rather cryptic. Can we add a helper with a relevant name/documentation to the linker, or the mirror class to fetch this?

This class is becoming a container for the jit states rather than just a storage for the profiling info. We should rename it (a later CL is fine)
