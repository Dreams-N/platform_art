Document the API of this method now that it has two parameters (since it is not immediate clear what is in current and what in instruction). Also, can current be null?

did you have a purpose of this field?
shouldn't it be called mCount in proper style?

I deleted it. I was copying a testcase included in the bug. But this variable isn't necessary to show the bug.

The reason this file is changed is with this CL, this assert fails. Since those unused parameters z,a,b,c,d,m will be spilled in the entry block (if it's not already passed on stack) due to the added HDeoptimize from bce. Changing to field accesses won't need HDeoptimize. This test will still test register hints.

Even without this additional live value, spilling is already forced. However I add another live here so that this test is causing the same number of spills so it's testing the same thing as before.
