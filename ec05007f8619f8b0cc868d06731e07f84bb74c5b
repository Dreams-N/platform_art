I think this Clear call (in SweepCallback) is new in the new code. I don't understand the rationale (the above comment). Can you elaborate?

We won't sweep if the live/mark bitmaps are bound. I think this takes case of the partial collection where we won't sweep zygote and replaces the logic w.r.t. 'sweep_space' and 'partial' in the old code. Right?
