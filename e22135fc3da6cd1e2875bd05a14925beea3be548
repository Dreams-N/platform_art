You're checking dex_location not null line 70 so I think you can remove this.

My understanding was that passing NULL to the std::string constructor is undefined behavior.

Perhaps it would be better for me to set dex_location_ = dex_location after the check in line 70, rather than passing dex_location_ to the constructor? What do you think?

Whatever avoids the "???" is fine by me :-)
