Honestly I do not think the complexity is required (and I really don't like exposing internals in a header file and pasting return code all over the place).

Isn't it enough to
 1) Remove SHARED_REQUIRES, as it's wrong
 2) Put a SOA here. How often are native methods synchronized? I don't think this is common in apps (and for the boot image - except for eng builds, JNI should really be compiled).
