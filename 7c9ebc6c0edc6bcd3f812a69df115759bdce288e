this *if*  is hard to read now due to the long scope.
Could you create a function here? like HandleFaultInGeneratedCode, or something similar.

I supposed to do that before.
But a *private* function must be added into FaultManager because some private data will be accessed here, and it should not be called from outside.
Looks like it's too much for this issue.
What's your opinion?

I would still add it. Having 90% of a long method under an if scope is less readable imo,
