Isn't converting to uint32_t, doing the shift, and converting back, easier and more readable?

I'm not deep enough in the code. But does this take Java semantics (preserved by dex) into account, i.e., is y in the right range when this is called? y is implicitly masked by 0x1f...

This has an impact here as you are not ensuring that y is non-negative, which is required in C/C++.
