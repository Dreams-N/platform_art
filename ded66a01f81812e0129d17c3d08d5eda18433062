It looks we no longer indirectly call GetInterfaceMethodIfProxy() via MethodHelper::GetMethod() at several call sites (GetReturnType(), GetDeclaringClass()) around here.

And that's ok because we don't expect proxy methods appear in any of those call sites, as I see DCHECK(!IsProxyMethod()) in ArtMethod::GetReturnType()?
