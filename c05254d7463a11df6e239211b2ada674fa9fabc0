Any reason why on MIPS you decided to always take the slow path irrespective of the load kind and undid the improvements I'd put in place recently? Unlike ARM and x86?

Also, what about the register input prepared by LocationsBuilderMIPS::VisitLoadString() and in dex_cache_array_fixups_mips.cc and pc_relative_fixups_mips.cc? Did you forget to adjust that?
