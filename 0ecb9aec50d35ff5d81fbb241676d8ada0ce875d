I suggest using GenRotateRight()'s code (with bugfixes/improvements in the relevant patch) as the common part here. The only difference will be the conditional change of shift to -shift at the beginning (note: you don't need shift to be int32_t, uint32_t will do just as well in our case).

Implement similarly to GenRotateRight(). Again, it's probably worth abandoning this 2nd patch altogether and implementing both rotate methods in the first one since they share most of the logic.
