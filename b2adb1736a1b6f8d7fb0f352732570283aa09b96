I think this should go above all the other includes.

Yes, that's our style, thanks, Vladimir.

This is missing a forward?

The header file intrinsics.h, above, includes code_generator.h; code_generator.h includes utils/label.h; utils/label.h declares Mips64Assembler.

Are you saying you think the code would be more readable if I added "class Mips64Assembler;" around line 31, or so?

Yes, I believe stuff you're using should be forward declared or explicitly included. I've been adding explicit includes all over the place for things that were included only indirectly.

We still rely quite a bit on transitive includes, but trying to go to include-what-you-use. It means that the dependencies are more explicit and visible, so you know what you're pulling in (or depending on) when you include a header / .cc file.

For example, the transitive chain you mention makes it harder to reason about separated backends...
