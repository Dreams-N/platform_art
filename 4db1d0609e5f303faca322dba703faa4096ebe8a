I think it's worse than that.  We really need bitwise comparison here, since we need to distinguish -0 and +0.
Can we just reinterpret_cast<int64_t> and compare the results as int64_t?

I think the result should be -0.0, right?
It's probably good to leave this as is until it actually fails.
Another good test might be (double)((1l << 53) - 1), which should map to itself.  And maybe (double)(1l << 55), which should do the same.
