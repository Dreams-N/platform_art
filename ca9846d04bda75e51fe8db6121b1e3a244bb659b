does this belong in CommonRuntimeTest where we set up the directory?

It felt like too much overhead. CommonRuntimeTest does not just recursively clean this directory, it also checks against its notion of dalvik cache and so on. So it would have been a non-trivial rewrite to make this non-static code static and accessible, whereas here we know there should be nothing in the tmp directory anymore.

it feels a bit weird that we call "set environment variables" which implicitly creates a directory and then we remove the directory in a sub-class. Perhaps QuickTestSetup for SetEnvironmentVariables and QuickTestSetup for the teardown. I wonder we could see the unbalanced problem again without something more intention revealing.
