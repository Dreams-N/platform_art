I don't think we should have this special-case here. If we want to optimize the true_val==false_val case, we should change the kMirOpSelect to CONST on the MIR level long before we get here.

In this instance we get it almost for free because there are overlapping cases. But yes I agree with you that the middle-end should optimize this case. Until that is done, it should be okay to leave this in.
