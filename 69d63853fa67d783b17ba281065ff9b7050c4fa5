Is that actually stated in any specification? Or are we adding it mostly because we can?

Take a guess. The rest of the dex spec talks about register pairs for longs, but not the invoke spec (because it doesn't really talk about parameters).

We don't expect non-contiguous register pairs anywhere. The verifier didn't, the compilers didn't (though it's only DCHECKs in Quick testing for it).

Ugh, I had to redo the file during development and obviously forgot to fix this the second time around.
