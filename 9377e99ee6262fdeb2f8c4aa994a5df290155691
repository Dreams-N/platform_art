Is there a guarantee that other != this?

Do you want me to handle that case? I can add a "this != &other" if you want me to.

The community seems to disagree. unique_ptr doesn't protect itself that way, either.

The reasoning is that the rvalue reference is supposed to be somewhat of an unnamed temp, so how can you assign it to self?

unique_ptr works but vector and string don't handle it, i suppose its rare to move assign something to itself

Thought style was to put this on the next line, also no explicit for constructor?

Move constructors should not be explicit. Will fix style.
