Should we somehow defend (eg with a DCHECK) against the possibility that this callback may move an object, as that would make the Class* pointers in new_class_roots_ (if not empty) invalid, if that happens? I assume this does not happen as of now, but it'd be nice to be able to defend it if it happens in a future change.

Is it more consistent if this param has a default value of kVisitRootFlagAllRoots?

So, about the usage of VisitRootFlags,

One of AllRoots and NewRoots is allowed (or effective).
One of StartLoggingNewRoots and StopLoggingNewRoots is allowed (or effective).
ClearRootLog can be combined with any other flag, but it clears the logs after a root scan (if effective).

Right?

Is it worth leaving a brief comment on this convention?
