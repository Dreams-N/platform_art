Seems to work, but would it make more sense to call MarkHeapReference() instead like the old code?

- SemiSpace's MarkHeapReference() already updates the root and we can remove the Assign call below?

- If a collector requires an atomic write (cas), calling MarkHeapReference() would allow the collector to use a cas internally without hardcoding a non-atomic write here? The CC collector does not currently use mod union tables, however.
