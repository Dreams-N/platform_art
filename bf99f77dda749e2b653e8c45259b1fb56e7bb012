Is that because MethodHelper needs a mutable handle (why?)? Seems like unnecessary overhead.

Its used to be that going from DexCache to DexFile was expensive, it isn't as much now. We had a mutable ArtMethod* in MethodHelper so that changing a method while walking a vtable say, wouldn't cause fresh DexFile lookups if the DexCache didn't change. When ArtMethods became move-able then these fields in MethodHelper became handles.
