just a minor nit, typically we recommend putting the true-branch on a new line (for one thing, line based debuggers cannot set breakpoint on return only here; but it is a bit more readable in general)

Please add a comment here explaining what could have went wrong before, and what this actually tests. Also, add the bug number.

I would move this test in a separate regression test (the bug number also gives context)m but I don't mind if you want to keep it here.

Added this comment before line 1118:
    // Bug: 22665511
    // A deoptimization will be triggered here right before the loop. Need to make
    // sure the value of j is preserved for the interpreter.

I'll just keep the test here with other BCE tests.
