Should we consider a null pointer as a valid input?  I would DCHECK(str != null) in debug mode; and return false – as you currently do – (and maybe log this) in non-debug mode.

We should stick to one and not support it in one mode but not the other. The fact that it's 'const char*' means it will always be a programmer-defined constant or string.c_str(), so turning it into a DCHECK seems safe.
