note that this test C is not covering as the other two yet, since it always seems to go through the interpreter (due to reflection to get a new instance)? so it only tests the interpreter part that was already correct [in contrast, A and B were true fail-before/pass-after tests).

Any pointers on how to force this to compile first time?

Reflection just does a regular invoke, so whatever the entry point is at the time is being called.

The class will soft-fail runtime verification, but that shouldn't set it up to be run through the interpreter (it will ensure at the moment that it won't ever be JIT-compiled). If that's happening, that's a bug.

You may want to debug dex2oat to see the compiler decision ( or verify that the oat file contains compiled code).
