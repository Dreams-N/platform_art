note that this test C is not covering as the other two yet, since it always seems to go through the interpreter (due to reflection to get a new instance)? so it only tests the interpreter part that was already correct [in contrast, A and B were true fail-before/pass-after tests).

Any pointers on how to force this to compile first time?
