Is it currently the case that either 1) the whole space is a one block (=main block) or 2) there are TLABs (and no main block)? If so, Walk() does not need to be written this (general) way that seems to suggest that there's a case where there are TLABs right after the main block, (though it works)?

Also, if main_block_size == Size() (End() - Begin()) always when the main block exists, then, maybe we do not need to store the main block size and instead could just have a boolean flag (is_there_main_block) instead (and call Size())?
