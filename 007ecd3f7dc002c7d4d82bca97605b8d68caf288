Why is it safe to remove the test?

I would have inlined the two line implementation, thus removing the need for at least most of the comment.

We shouldn't enqueue a reference that's already pending-enqueued, correct? If so, is the original comment better phrased ("without checking" for a performance reason) because this new comment would make it sound like it's valid to enqueue a reference that may already be pending-enqueued?

I think EnqueuePendingReference should be a private function, that is used only internally. It may currently be used in a few places instead of EnqueueReference to improve performance. I'll look into this some more.

Does this sort depends on the discussion in bug 26647823?

How about keeping the comment "once enqueued, the pending next is always non-null"?

This does not depend on the answer to the question in b/26647823. I'll update the comment as you suggest.

In light of Jeremy's comment in the other discussion is "WasPendingEnqueued" or just "PendingEnqueued" a better name?

This returns true even if the reference is no longer on any queue.
