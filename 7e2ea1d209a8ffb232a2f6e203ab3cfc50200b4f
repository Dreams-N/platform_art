I had to disable this test because calling DescribeVRegs here causes a crash. There is no register line at this dex pc. WAI ?
Note I didn't disable such calls in the "long" test.

My first version used kConstant (which is handled by the CatchBlockVisitor when deoptimizing). In the context of the test, we're supposed to be in compilation mode (Runtime::IsCompiler == true) so the method verifier use imprecise constants only.

We should have control on that by passing a boolean to the MethodVerifier upon construction so the behavior is the same than during deoptimization at runtime.
