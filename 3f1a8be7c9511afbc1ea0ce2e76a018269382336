I'm intrigued and want to know more! What is it that makes it so interesting?

I'll do the translator for Aart: David wants a checker test :)

Thanks Nicolas but your Davidspeak is a little rusty. I was suggesting that Aart describes in better detail what the situation causing the DCHECK to fail looked like. A Checker test would not be able to do that because the bug is on an intermediate step of the transformation. Plus it's such a minor change that I wouldn't harass Aart over it.

That said, you are right that a Checker test would guarantee that the test keeps testing the same thing in the future.
