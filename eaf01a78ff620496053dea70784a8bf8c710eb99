If current_capacity_ is not even you'll have an off by 1 difference here compared to when the code cache is created.

Not an issue in practice but consistency is nice (i.e. current_capacity_ - current_capacity_/2).

I'd write some helpers and constify `2` when accessing the data/code capacity.

I'd be explicit and add `_bytes_` at the end.
