I'm missing something here: isn't it the main thread that destroys the Runtime? And we assume it was already detached? In which conditions can it not be null?

It doesn't have to be, I believe. JNI allows any thread to shut down the runtime.

However, for our tests it shouldn't be, so I was dubious before.

But it's fine to continue? Why is that not a FATAL?

It doesn't continue, it shuts down. Maybe worth changing to LOG(FATAL) but I fear this would introduce a lot of bugs in automated testing / etc.
