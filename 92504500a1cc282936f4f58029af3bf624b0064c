I assume this means "in the background".

Maybe should 'delta' be of type intptr_t to support potentially large heap cases (eg, what if we grow the heap by 3 GB under 64-bit)?

In this addition, since bytes_allocated is of type size_t (unsigned), is this safe for a shrink case where delta < 0 with regard to implicit type conversions?

Also, is it possible that the 2.0x multiplier causes we shrink too aggressively and end up with a negative target_size (which would unintentionally be a very large positive number as it's unsigned)?
