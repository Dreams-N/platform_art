This comment is not clear to me; do you mean "Multi-byte UTF-16 involved"?

I can improve the comment:

'The "bltu" conditional branch tests to see if the character value fits in a valid 16-bit (MIPS halfword) value. If it doesn't then the character being searched for, if it exists in the string, is encoded/stored in the string using UTF-16 into two (16-bit) halfwords. Currently the assembly code used to implement this intrinsic doesn't support searching for a character stored as two halfwords so we fallback to using the generic implementation of indexOf().'

Is this okay?

Why is this logic here (and not in `art_quick_indexof`)?

I'm not sure what you're asking.

If you're asking why there isn't logic in `art_quick_indexof` to choose between "seleqz/selnez", and "movz/movn", none of these instruction appear in `art_quick_indexof`. They did appear in an earlier version of the CL but since then I've defined/used the MINu macro which conditionally selects between the R6, and pre-R6 instructions. See the file runtime/arch/mips/asm_support_mips.S.

If you are asking why doesn't `art_quick_indexof` have a test for 'fromIndex < 0'? It doesn't need to, this code prevents that condition from happening when `art_quick_indexof` is called.

Or are you asking something else?

Why is there no null check similar to the ones on lines 1886 and 1943?

Because I patterned to code after the ARM implementation, and the ARM implementation of these three intrinsics follows the same pattern. I can add the test. Is this a bug in the ARM implementation?

What about implementing and using these `MINs` and `MINu` macros for MIPS64 as well?

They can be implemented for MIPS64 but weren't because only because we're not supporting pre-R6 64-bit MIPS implementations so the MIPS64 doesn't need to use #if-#else-#endif.

Do you want these macros added to this patch or do you want them in a separate patch?

The only difference between the definitions of `MINu` and `MINs` is this line; could you try to refactor these definitions?
