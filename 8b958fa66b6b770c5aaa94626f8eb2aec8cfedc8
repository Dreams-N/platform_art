would the plan for these unimplementeds to turn them into "xorq reg, [mem]" where mem holds the 64-bit immediate? You may want to do that before forcing the caller's to avoid non-32bit immediates.

I would prefer turning them into "xorq reg, TMP", but that means we need a TMP register for the assembler. For now I'm fine just having the caller know it cannot call this method with 64bits immediate.

Andreas's CL (that got submitted) does a CHECK on the immediate which is fine by me.
