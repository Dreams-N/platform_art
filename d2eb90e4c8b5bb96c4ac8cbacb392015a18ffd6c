Seems a bit weird to talk about old code here in the present tense.

New style is supposedly new lines here:

 exp1
     ? exp2
     : exp3

or so...

I'll let Alex check this. Is the interpreter now installed for default method conflicts?

One could argue that you formed a do-while loop. Don't know whether we like them stylistically (I think it's at least more expressive when reading from here).

Not sure I like the change to make result_register a pointer, as it makes this here slower (and moves are common in dex code). It seems an alternative would have been to take the address when dispatching to mterp, considering that the interpreters don't have a common Execute signature anymore anyways because of single-stepping.

Could we hide this in a function exposed by interpreter.h? That way the runtime doesn't need to know about mterp.

Unnecessary, looks like you should be able to forward-declare instead.

I'd prefer to hide mterp by an interpreter layer, but I think that's overkill, probably.

Can be const functions and return const void*?
