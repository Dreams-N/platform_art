const here and on the return type.

constexpr would be even better but for that I would need

  protected:
    ~Pass() = default;

and that makes the gcc -Wnon-virtual-dtor complain. I could work around that with a #pragma but the derived classes should really be marked final and the host build on my development machine uses gcc 4.6 without support for C++11 final classes.

Top-level const on function arguments is almost completely meaningless. I would discourage its usage.
