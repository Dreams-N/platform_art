Add a comment on what this is. Why can't you type it?

It's a ucontext. But it's handed down from the signal handler as a void*, and I did not want to add another dependency here and to utils.h. The result will be cast in utils.cc, where the type is known from the inclusion of libbacktrace.

I don't know if it worthwhile to avoid a ucontext.h import if that is what is at stake here. system header files don't change as often as ones within art.
