What about Throw instructions? From my reading, they aren't CanThrow...

Good point, they aren't CanThrow. We probably could make them CanThrow.

It works because they aren't expressions: they are control flow instructions that occur at the end of a block. Since that block is branching to the exit block, HThrow instructions cannot be part of a loop.

I added the CanThrow anyways.
