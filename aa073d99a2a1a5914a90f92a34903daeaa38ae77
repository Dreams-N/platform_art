What's the reason for this change?

My guess is that was made lower-case as there is no other user, so it's a Makefile "local," which we keep lower-cased.

I'm not sure about the uppercase/lowercase convention here, but changing this to uppercase as it looked like other variables that are to be passed in from the command line are in uppercase, as in, "mm ART_DEFAULT_GC_TYPE=CMS..." rather than "mm art_default_gc_type=cms...".
