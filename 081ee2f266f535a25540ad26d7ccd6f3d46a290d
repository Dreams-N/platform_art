Please use a more revealing name and add documentation. *New* will not be so *new* anymore after a few weeks.

? :-)

New is not because I wrote this code yesterday, but it denotes I am creating a new node, possibly simplified.

See L103-113 in the header, NewInvariantOp, NewInvariantFetch, NewInduction.

arh, ok, my bad :)

The rest of the code uses CreateSomething though...

Ah, I see, I can rename them in Create if that is the common nomenclature. I also like it when teams use one style consistently, so we all read code easier.

Do you actually see this in practice? I'd assume other optimization phases would take care of it already.

Yes, the 1, 0, and probably -1 are very common in induction. Note that these nodes are not in the HIR yet. If they would be, indeed instruction simplification would kick in, which is why I only do some light weight here, I will rely on HIR simplification later. But avoiding some of the very obvious cases saves a ton of new nodes in memory during analysis (viz. x + 0 and 1 * x occur a lot, see the tests alone already).

My point is that you can rely on HIR simplification, as we are already doing it. The fewer code the better :)

I fully agree with that, which is why I did not have this earlier. But while working with it a bit, it seems a bit of a waste to have all those nodes in memory for nothing (also it makes debugging output easier to read, but that would not be my sole reason).

But won't that memory only be there under your test? 

Realistically, in production, after we run the simplifier pass, you won't have those nodes, right?

No, this is the internal representation of normalized induction expressions. E.g. range analysis, but also loop optimization use these nodes to determine how the induction is formed.

I have a CL ready that does range analysis, and uses this in BCE. I can put that out as a WIP to give you a better idea on how this works. But in essence, the induction_ mapping is what is needed by later phases.

Yes, I understand :-) What I'm saying is that those a + 0, a * 1 nodes, you'll never see them in production because the instruction simplifier will have removed them.

Put in the meanwhile, it adds to the memory footprint during analysis. Since we will pass induction_ mapping to next phases, having hundred  "100 * i + x" will take a lot less bytes than the same hundred "(100 * 1) * i + (x + 0)". So if you only care about the eventually generated code, then yes, but I guess we also care about how much memory the optimizing compiler itself uses, right?

Let's chat offline, this conversation is ending up like a dialogue of the deaf :-)

I'm not talking about the generated code. I'm taking about whether this induction pass will ever see, eg (1 * a) in the HIR.
