Should we move this into some utility class so we can use it in other places as well?

Hmmm... I kind of like that the DWARF code is self contained.
I am happy to put it to some ART utility file as well.

I am also considering removing the hashing altogether and doing something else.  But I will need to measure performance of that.

My concern is that I think this isn't the only place we have FNV hash implementation (e.g. strtab writer also had one before you removed the full class). Currently I don't see any easy solution to remove the hash but you can give it a try.

Should I move it to std_util.h?

Maybe... Do you consider this a replacement for the std::hash<>?

There no std::hash for std::vector, right?

http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/functional/hash/ says there is at least for std::vector<bool> but std::vector<uint8_t> is not guaranteed.

The more I think of it, the more I believe that stl_util.h would be a good place for this utility.

I agree and I think we should expand it to work on std::vector<int8_t>, std::vector<uint8_t>, std::vector<int16_t>, etc... (where this algorithm makes sense)

Why do you add 2 attribute list end marker?

That is how DWARF defines the end of attribute list.

Thanks for the explanation (looks strange for me)

I would prefer to not push and pop the abbrev table terminator every time we are adding a new entry. Can we just move it to some finalization code?

I am not sure whether complexity of finalization code is worth it (in particular, making sure it is called).
Not that there so few abbrevs that the cost of doing this is basically irrelevant.

Cost of doing it is close to 0 because it won't require any additional relocation. The code flow is a bit strange for me but if it is not easy to change then I am ok with the current solution.
