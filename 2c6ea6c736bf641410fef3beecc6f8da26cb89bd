Have you also tested that the test failed on a build without the fix present?

I don't properly understand how this test works because I haven't checked out test_dex_file_builder, and I don't know where the value 'lu' comes from, so this may be a stupid question:

Does the implication that this ASSERT_EQ carries meaningful information rely on the assumption that dex_file2->NumStringIds() is different from lu? If yes, should we assert this here?
