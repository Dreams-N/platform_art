This operator is overloaded to perform string comparison, but in my view, it could be confusing as the lhs is a const char*. I don't know what the style guide is on this, and it's probably a matter of taste.

How about calling String::compare() explicitly, use GetDescriptorEquals() or put GetDescriptor() on the lhs at least?

This comment applies to many places in this CL.

I tend to get confused with this, there's no object lifetime issue between std::string and its c_str() (c_str() is still in use while std::string goes out of scope) here and in other places, correct?

Are these turned into static functions because we don't want to do the "h_this" thing? Any other reason? Why does ComputeName() use the h_this thing and while these don't?

Presumably ComputeName allocates a string and needs handle.
