I don't want to shrink the HashSet. And it doesn't make any sense to expand the HashSet if it's empty because of low load factor since the load factor will remain 0. It would be absurd to repeatedly reallocate the storage if we call SetLoadFactor() repeatedly with the same arguments.

Done, I don't see use cases where people would repeatedly call SetLoadFactor though.
