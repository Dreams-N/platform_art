Why is this required if the map is not shared across multiple threads?

Yeah, I added this in all calls. I get a little nervous not having this in case map ever changes to being passed around.

I can remove this and add a comment so that nobody forgets this is only okay because the map is created here.

Im fine with this here, its not performance critical.
