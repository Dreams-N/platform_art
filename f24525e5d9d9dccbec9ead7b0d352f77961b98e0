Is it not safe to ignore
  mov w0, w0
?
If it is safe, we need to add `kDiscardForSameWReg` as the last parameter of the move.

Note that executing the 'mov w0, w0' instruction has the side effect of clearing the top 32 bits of x0. I think it should be safe.

Just a note: at some point we will want to optimise this to use LDP and STP (load pair and store pair).

Here and in other places: what about `kNoOutputOverlap`?

Was that a comment for x86? If so remove.

Here and in other places: why 'size' and not 'type'?

I'm fine if it stays like this, but as a note, in VIXL we generally shorten MacroAssembler to masm. Assembler refers to a parent class of the MacroAssembler. The Assembler can only generate 'real' instructions, while the MacroAssembler takes care of a lot of things for the user (eg. constants that don't fit in immediate fields, or optimising away mov x1, x1).

This function generates code for a compare exchange, isn't it?
Can we use LDXR and STXR in the loop, and have a DMB before loop_head and after exit_loop?

Here and below: HeapOperand() ?
You could even pass thee offsets without calling the Int32Value() member.

Should there be a 'LOG(FATAL)'?
