as Andreas mentioned, it's either correct or not :)

I don't see an immediate gain for this and we are more verbose. What's the actual benefit? equal instructions returned and HIntConstant before as well based on the previous implementation of the static evaluation?

Could you rephrase your last sentence?  I had a hard time parsing it. :)

The benefit is that we can properly process operations with different signatures regarding inputs and output, e.g.:

- arithmetic operations: (T, T) → T
- condition (including merged compare & condition) : (T, T) → bool ("converted" to int).
- comparisons: (T, T) → int

So I separated the dispatch part (Evaluate) from the computation part (Compute*), much like the Visitor design pattern does.  Sometimes the latter is the same for all cases; sometimes we have various cases (e.g. ComputeIntegral vs ComputeFP).  See also https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/161016 for more examples.

Sorry for the bad wording.

I missed that actually for HEqual we returned either an int32 or an int64.

how about shift which can be "long << int"

Can this actually happen?  Dex instructions such as shl-int or shl-long expect either two ints or two longs.  Also, the code generators seem to handle only (int, int) and (long, long) cases; e.g. see art::arm::InstructionCodeGeneratorARM::HandleShift.

(And currently the worst case is, this doesn't get optimized by constant folding.)

during codegen, for long, the second argument gets a register so maybe this is why is not immediately clear that you can have a HLongConstant << HIntConstatn.

try a simple example:
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    long x = 23l << args.length;
    System.out.println(x);
  }

Note: this was present in the initial code (see Base set, line 2679); I just moved it higher for dependency reasons.

This is required by art::HGraph::GetNullConstant, which instantiates an art::HNullConstant (the ctor of which is private).

DCHECK, otherwise we get might get a sigsegv which is less readable.

I've added DCHECKs, here and in other HConstant subclasses.

thanks, 

Sometime when stuff gets moved is harder to see what changed and what not.

why not HConstant  then?

Because:
1. I'm using overloading to select the right method here (see TryStaticEvaluation methods);
2. We need the exact type of the concrete classes to be able to call x->GetValue().

I think an HIntConstant here with and if IsIntConstant would save lines when we invokes this. But I dont' mind if you want to keep it like this.
