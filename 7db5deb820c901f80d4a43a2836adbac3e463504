size_t may be 64-bit, depending on what machine the compiler runs. However, you movl the result as 32-bit, since you compile for x86.

So the use of uint32_t seems better (done elsewhere too).

By similar argument, this should be a uint64_t to avoid issues when cross compiling for x86_64 on a 32-bit host.

Or, if this is always  uint32_t, then perhaps best to use that type here too?
