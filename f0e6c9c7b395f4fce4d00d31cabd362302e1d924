Somewhat surprised that this is long->double->float rather than long->float. Is there an issue with VcvtF32[SU]32 and a lack of precision?

Single float has only 23 significand and 1 sign bit. It is not enough for a 32-bit int. It will lost precision if use single float as intermediate variable in this logic.
