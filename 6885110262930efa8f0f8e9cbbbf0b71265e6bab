It was unclear that this was intended to be mutable, I'd document this is expected to be set/advanced as needed by processors

i'd visually separate these from the above too since they change with each StartClass/EndClass.

I'm not sure the template struct vs a little abstract class with subclasses is the clearest way to do this.

that said, the name is definitely unclear. Can we do something like MapBinder -> DeDuper?

(looking at the other file, I think part of the confusion for me in the "Map" part of the name is that its just a coincidence to me that these are are "map" like data.)
