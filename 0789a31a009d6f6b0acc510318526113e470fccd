remove.

This will show up in user builds and there's nothing that can be done to correct it. 

I guess it's something that we will need to deal with it when perf-ing and manually investigate if it happens.

Actually I think we should keep it. --perf being a developer tool, you should know what you're doing.

Maybe you can increase the message by saying "Are you on a user build? Perf only works on userdebug/eng builds".
