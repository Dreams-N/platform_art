Why this change? I haven't seen any changes in the art script that would require this executable. Maybe you meant to add it to build-art-host?

I thought about delaying this but the goal is that the next CL will enabled patching pregenerated .oat files automatically in ANDROID_DATA, so it doesn't hurt to start building this.

can we just add this as a CompilerOptions that is in CompilerDriver so we don't have to pass it through all the layers explicitly? clearly we have it here at this point and even one layer below.

I did it like this because I think we should have the patch information regardless of how we compile it. ISTM that the option is only whether or not to write it out.

if this is the same as include_patches, I'd call it the same name consistently thoughout.

i'd probably add the comment explaining that it is unsupported for now. its obvious why this is here now, because i just saw the mclinker change, but it won't be obvious later

i agree that we should have this comment, but is this the right place? somewhere where we are actually calculating the size of the patches makes more sense to me.

we don't need the argument here right? it is in oat_file_?

Yes we need it. This is the File* that the elf_file is in. We need it to fully map in the elf file and add patching information.

while clever, I assumed this would be in SetPatchLocation. i see this way that the patch information is scoped to this function. but that could be done with an out argument. I thought you might be doing this because there were a lot of cases in SetPatchLocation, but there aren't, there is just one. plus you have kind of a hacky return value now where 0 implies relative vs absolute, which is just for the convenience of maybe_push.

I don't think we should be reserving our own section type, I'd just use a named section.

Again. It seems like this is more an option controlling whether it gets written out and doesn't seem to belong in the compiler_options.

i wondered why you didn't do this in the other test where you set to true but then set back to false if portable.

In the other test we just use the default compiler and it is not possible to determine the kind from a given compiler.

do you depend on the compiler parts? if not, you can leave these out if you just need the runtime.

I'd rather avoid using these I think some ABIs might have effectively used some of these.

It shouldn't. Sections for specific processor ABI's should be between SHT_LOPROC and SHT_HIPROC. OS & associated tools sections (i.e. for BSD/GNU tools we use) are kept between SHT_LOOS and SHT_HIOS.

Between LOUSER and HIUSER is reserved for application use. This means that since niether linux nor our loader uses it we should be free to do so.

Anyway if it becomes a problem it would be easy to change the value then.

We can have negative patch deltas and I think that the header should not hide that fact.
