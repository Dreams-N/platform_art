Please do not change an existing test. This test is meant for checker, and the one you copied over, for running the test.

out of curiosity, why bother changing these?

Do we really want this? It would be ok with me if we didn't run any code.

I don't really mind running these but I think it will be a bit misleading. The goal here is to have checker run on this. Just running them and say that they pass kinda defeats the purpose.

I think this comment looks a bit cryptic for external readers; could you be a bit more specific?

Especially since this is on a *-checker-* test line 509.

I think you should also move the definition of `run_args' outside this `if' statement (i.e. just after line 512) so that these tests are run in the same fashion, whatever the runtime/compiler used (even if the dumped graph is not used in some cases).
