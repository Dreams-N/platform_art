I check these changes by running art tests in 64 -bit host mode.

Removing this int3 allows test 103 to pass.

I am not sure about SETUP_REF_ONLY_CALLEE_SAVE_FRAME. It is equal to SETUP_SAVE_ALL, and takes Method* from runtime, not RDI as QCG64 ABI specifies. But it is another place in entrypoints.

This int3 does not affect art tests but visually it looks correct and equal to NO_ARG/TWO_ARG cases
