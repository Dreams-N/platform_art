Shouldn't that be a LMain$AbstractClass; ? Otherwise the verifier error you get here is that m does not exist on LB21646347;

The point here was that Main$AbstractClass.m() is Miranda. So what the verifier did was take the declaring class (the interface), then check the receiver against it. Even though the receiver is of a totally different class, this would pass, as interface checks aren't done at verification time.

So you're basically right, you'll get an error about B21646347 (it's not assignable to AbstractClass), but that is exactly what it's supposed to be testing.
