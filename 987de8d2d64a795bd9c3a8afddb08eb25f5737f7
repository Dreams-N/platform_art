I put ART_TARGET_ANDROID to match the #ifdefs used in Dlopen for populating host_dlopen_handles_.

The important thing is that this block of code run at least whenever the corresponding block of code in Dlopen runs (lines 650, 664). It's okay if this block of code runs more often than the corresponding block in Dlopen.

Would you like me to change this?

Up to you. Not using a macro makes sure the code gets compiled no matter what.
