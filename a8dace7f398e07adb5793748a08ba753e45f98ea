Why use a load exclusive? Is this what was mentioned the other day, where you try to achieve atomicity?

Unless other code accessing the target memory also use load/store exclusive, I don't think the 'exclusive' brings anything.

Is what you want to know whether the LDRD is loads the 64 bits atomically? In this case have a look at `ArmInstructionSetFeatures::has_atomic_ldrd_strd_`.
