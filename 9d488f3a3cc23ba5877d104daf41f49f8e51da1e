Would you mind sharing the performance data for this? I would've expected (given a good load balance factor) that open addressing has 1 less cache miss on average than with chaining.

This would seem to indicate a lot of collisions today. Is there more detailed data?

Why not just fix the the string hash function to be produce more distributed results, resulting in less collisions?

(or in fact, since this is prezygote strings why not make this into a perfect hash table?)

In total or just the # of components? I see the default load factor is 1.0 which could account for the smaller size.

Given equivalent load factors I would expect the chained version to be larger given the need to store edge pointer data.
