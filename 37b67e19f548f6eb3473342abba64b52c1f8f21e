Could you also change this to "marking" (here and elsewhere)?  I think the current phrasing is a bit ambiguous (my bad), as it can be interpreted as "the slow path that is generated/taken to mark the object `ref`" (correct interpretation) or "the slow path was doing the marking, but not anymore" (wrong interpretation).
