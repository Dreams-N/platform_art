This is an intentional failure that SHOULD HAVE NOT made it in the patch I upstreamed. Sorry for that! 

A valid load/ store (IS_BINARY_OP) will fail, dumping the LIR and aborting on CHECK(false). This was added to catch all the uses of Load/Store without offsets and to extend the LOAD_STORE_FILTER.

I will retest both arches, run CTS and upstream the proper version this time.
