I find "baseline_" not meaningful enough. What about "enable_optimizations_" (or something close)?

Baseline is pretty standard in compilers and JITs, so if we do call it the |"baseline" compiler I'd rather keep that flag for consistency. Instead of the baseline compiler we could call it the "unoptimizing compiler", but I'd prefer baseline.

I think baseline is standard in v8/dart. Baseline in other contexts means a different compiler which is generally taking an instruction and splatting it to a machine code pattern. I think there's some ambiguity here as to whether something like register allocation would be an "optimization". Perhaps explain what a baseline compile would do somewhere.

Just a naming thing, I agree with Sebastien. The term does not convey enough meaning and even though description clarifies it. Additionally, baseline and optimizing do not capture enough "gears" :) But this is fine for now, I can get used to it.
