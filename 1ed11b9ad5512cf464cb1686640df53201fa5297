Does this mean that some of the entries_ are strong GC roots and others are weak GC roots and that the strong/weak boundary changes dynamically (as we add more alloc records), correct? 
Maybe leave a comment about this where entries_ is declared?

And I assume that works in terms of GC correctness.

Side note: I guess another reason it's safe for now is that we only read those GcRoots in AllocRecordObjectMap during a pause for hprof dumping (no read barrier triggers for those GcRoots). Thus, we don't need to temporarily disable new alloc records here for concurrent reference processing.
