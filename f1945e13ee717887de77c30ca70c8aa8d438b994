Linear scan has extra invariants to maintain in this function, such as that live intervals are sorted.

BlockRegister is implementation-dependent.
One option is to have a virtual function for it, but it's not clear that all register allocators would want one.

This is implementation-dependent. Linear scan blocks the output register and shifts the live interval, but graph coloring simply splits the live interval.

This is partially implementation-dependent; linear scan has similar code, but also has to maintain the unhandled_{core,fp}_intervals_, making code sharing not ideal.

although graph coloring is of course well known, this would be the right place to document your algorithm a bit at very high level, and give credit to references you may have used

super nit: you are using two forms of the verb in your methods: e.g. ensure vs. ensures
I would use one style consistently

nit: typically nouns are better for fields than verbs, which are better for methods

is this a "note to self" for later? without actionable code (like a check or test), this won't do much more?
