IIUC, you no longer trust app class initialization, right? So calling a static method of an app class from another app class will always have to do that check?

Isn't the issue in the app class initialization itself (InitializeClass function) ? I mean we would incorrectly initialize an app class (changing its status to kStatusInitialized) at compilation time while it won't be at runtime?
