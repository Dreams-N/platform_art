Move this allocation to main() and surround the entire body of run() in a try-catch block for OOME and Throwable?

Hm. That brings us back to what the test is supposed to do. It was allocating thread-local before, even the list.

And wrapping everything in an OOME means that it won't wait for other threads before releasing that storage.

Why? Normal Java convention says not to catch errors at all. I'm fine with a timeout terminating the test in that case.
