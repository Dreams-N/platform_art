Don't know.  The apple changes worked on my laptop.  Don't know why it's not x86_64 though.  Maybe I need an environment variable or something.  Ian?  Any insights?

Maybe you need manually edit this file to enable the 64-bit host build.
Ex:
fu@fu-ubuntu:/disk/dev/aosp/build$ git diff
diff --git a/core/envsetup.mk b/core/envsetup.mk
index d0b5846..f48cc25 100644
