The name is bad. If the check is inline (which I can see for performance reasons, then call it Try...

I also originally meant to move the other_handlers_ code out, not everything. This is still a large function with two separate concerns. Would prefer moving the whole stuff after "// We hit" into its own function, to have this look clean and maintainable...

This check is too big to make it inline.
Agree. Will only move out the part of other handlers.

Why "true"? This is still a failure case that should terminate, so should be propagated along the chain.

(And no, we will not accept other_handlers_ that fix up internal state in managed code...)

Just follow the original code, which will return directly.
I'm not sure about the motivation of other_handlers_.
So far, only the JavaStackTraceHandler is added in other_handlers_, which always return false in its Action.
Will any new handler be added into it in future?
