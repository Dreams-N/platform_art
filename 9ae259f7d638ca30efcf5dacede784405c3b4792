is there really no better way of doing this ?

As discussed with pszczepaniak@, we have several possible solutions for tagging socket:
1. Change every call to {socket, accept, close} to JVM version and do the tagging there. (The implementation)
2. Same as 1, but call the underlying native tagging function directly. However the native function specifically binds to NetworkManagementSocketTagger, therefore would be broken if a different SocketTagger implementation is registered.
3. Do tag/untag at each occurrence of {socket, accept, close}. This is a lot of duplicate code and hard to maintain.
4. Rewrite functions involving these calls in pure Java.

did you actually enumerate the number of occurences of (3) ? I don't think there are a "lot", and besides many of them call through to common methods - like NetHooks.beforeTcpConnect. I would prefer that strategy to this one.

accept(): 2
close(): 36
socket(): 12

Alternatively, (1) could also be done in libcore by using a different name, e.g. NET_{Socket,Accept,SocketClose}. Would you think this is a better strategy?

I think that would be a better strategy. In the future, if we decide to add more things there (or rewrite them in java, which is too risky for this release) we can do so quite easily. What do you think ?

this seems broken - why are you untagging the return value of close ?
