does this need to be conditional on lhs being a byte register?

The `Register` type does not encode the width of the registers, but only a register id, so we can't check that here.
The requirements for register sizes between codegen stubs are implicit. The arm64 port will propose a different approach enforcing register size coherency (which will certainly come with its own issues!).

Yeah, the register allocator would need to know we need a register byte (we already do that in this file).

Since requesting byte registers are annoying, I decided to go with doing a xor before moving the setcc result. See:
