Why is this classified as linear for multiplications?

This is the transfer over * (so think derived, not basic).
So if we have x * y
  where x is classified linear as a_ * i + b_
  and y is classified as invariant, just itself,
we get a new linear expression
   (a_ * y) * i + (b_ * y)

Perhaps naming the parameters x and y instead of a and b would be a bit more clear to see the difference between top and sub expressions better (as I realized writing down the explanation :-)
