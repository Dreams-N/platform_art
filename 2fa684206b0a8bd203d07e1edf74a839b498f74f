This is a bit vector. I woudn't have expected to take so much allocated space. How much do you save? What if we stack allocated it and not use the arena?

How do you want to stack-allocate the variable-size vector?

(Usually, this would be an 8 byte allocation per call but it would be more for methods with high number of blocks - exactly those that eat most memory and make most calls here.)
