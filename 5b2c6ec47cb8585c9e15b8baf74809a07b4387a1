Am I preserving this behavior?

It appears this means we must have a checksum (the original dex can't be stripped) to consider an (not already opened) oat file up to date, but I thought no checksum meant we assume up to date (Which is what FindOpenedOatDexFile does).

See also class_linker.cc#912, class_linker.cc#1220, and dalvik_system_DexFile.cc#329, where they all consider an oat file up to date if there is no dex checksum available.
