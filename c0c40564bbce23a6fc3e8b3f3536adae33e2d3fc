This seems like an inappropriate place for this comment. A better comment would describe the missing checks that should take place, and place the description of the missing "reference super type" in the RegType hierarchy where it should be added.

There's a bug open for this, so I am keeping track of the bigger picture. :-)

I thought it's a good point to put the comment here where there would have to be actual changes. I agree that the general issue of missing a common, special supertype for initialized and uninitialized references, should probably be detailed there.
