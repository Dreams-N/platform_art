I merged to get rid of the test breakage, but my question is: is that still correct?

Would the proper thing be to change the switch and just have 

 case kArm:
   FALLTHROUGH_INTENDED();
 case kThumb2:
   ...

yntil such time as we actually treat kArm and kThumb2 different wrt/ codegen?

What's the meaning of DW_ISA_ARM_arm? Does it mean that the code is ARM? Or does it allow mixed ARM and Thumb2 code?
