This actually means we don't trace native methods anymore. This has been wrong for a while, though, and when I mentioned it to Brian a while ago he was under the impression we did this correctly before (maybe before we fully deopted).

You're right, disabling that flag will skip instrumentation for native. I'll fix that in the next PS.

When we instrument code with interpreter, we must keep updating native method's entrypoint with the instrumentation entry/exit stubs, interpreter only applies to pure Java methods.

I'd like to test entrypoints in instrumentation_test too. I could not manage to do that because there is no oat file during these tests.
