You just DCHECKED that.

I added the dchecks to get early failures in debug builds in case I left something out (since this data is coming from the framework which I don't constantly watch for changes). Would like to keep them around for a while.

How about LOG(WARNING) or LOG(ERROR) then?

I don't want this to fail in non-debug builds and LOG(ERROR) guarded by kDebugBuild is the same as a dcheck.

I can log a warning, but if something changes it could take longer until we notice it.

(I don't feel strongly about this)

I'd go with a LOG(WARNING): you don't expect this to happen. The DCHECK is only here for you, isn't it? As no one runs devices with libartd.

The reason I'm being picky is how the following code is confusing:
DCHECK(foo);
if (!foo) { // dead code??? }
