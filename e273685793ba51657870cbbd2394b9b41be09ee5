Makes sense to move this to MIRGraph constructor since we always create this special temporary.

And, this "negative value" for compiler temps makes life a bit ugly elsewhere in the code.  I've probably flushed out the bulk of the issues by getting the method pointer special working - but beware of code that expects to index an array based on vreg.

I moved the register information to stack.h since stack layout is dependent on this. Let me know if there is a better place to move these.

Instead of defines we can add static methods to get these fields.

Off the top of my head, I don't remember for sure why I started with -2 for Method* - but I might be using -1 as the code for an invalid or unknown Dalvik vreg.  When I'm at work tomorrow, I'll take a look at the code to jog my memory.
