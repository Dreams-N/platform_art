Should this be DexFile::kDexNoIndex16? or should we have a constexpr value for 0x10000U?

I should have made it a constant.

This is *not* kDexNoIndex16, as that is a valid return (as in "I didn't find anything"). This, which is >16b, signals an error when trying to load something.

Cleanup CL later.

This feels like kDexNoIndex16 to me.

In this case I guess one could reuse kDexNoIndex16, but that check was missing before. For the "bigger" picture see the other comment.
