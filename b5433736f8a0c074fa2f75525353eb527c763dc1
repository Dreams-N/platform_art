Good question. No bug, but the old code was too conservative. I found a few test cases where a definition went from one loop to another, but neither loop was nested in the other. The new implementation detects that too.

I even have a unit test for that, but without the BCE part that is a bit harder to test exactly. So if you are okay, I will add that unit test to the other CL.

See the other file. When we just had the TC expression, it made sense to just use b (just like neg). Now that we have top test and TC, I thought the a/b order was a bit more logical.
