What about VERIFY_ERROR_NO_METHOD, ACCESS_METHOD and CLASS_CHANGE? They should all be handled by the trampolines you're calling.

(They're not necessarily unresolved, but the "effect" is the same.)

Yea, I know. I was mostly "bothered" by the name inconsistency and the fact that I don't have tests yet. I will enable them eventually.

Maybe it will be good to rename this to "can_be_handled_by_compiler" or something similar.
