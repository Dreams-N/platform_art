CodeChecksumMethodProcessor (above) and MapChecksumMethodProcessor are used to perform the checksum calculation in order, i.e. all header+code chunks first, then GC maps, then mapping tables and then vmap tables. However, each iteration in ProcessDexMethods takes almost 50ms for boot.oat on N5 (4 additional passes -> almost 200ms). If we don't care about the checksum being done in order, we could merge these into the previous passes.
