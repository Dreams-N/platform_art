This is not ideal, but it has been working for me to get started with the tests.
Other suggestions:
- We could instead filter on tests called `\d+-checker-(arm|arm64|mips64|x86|x86_64)-.*` in `run-test` and only run the checker part if it matches the arch.
- Could some logic in checker handle that? Something like a `CHECK-<ARCH>` line? But that would mean passing arch information to `checker.py`.
