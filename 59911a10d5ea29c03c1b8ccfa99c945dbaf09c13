isn't this a bug in the DEFINE_FUNCTION macro?

I didn't want to change DEFINE_FUNCTION because that would have an impact on every invocation of it.  This instance matches the call in MACRO2.  This change makes the symbol match the other '...throw..' symbols.  

This is actually only temporary as the stack reduction CL removes these '...from_signal' routines (they are not needed).

The point of the DEFINE_FUNCTION macro is to remove the OS dependencies in this file. SYMBOL is used when trying to reference a SYMBOL in code, so this use is a kludge. Where is the MACRO2 code, I'm not seeing it looking at the code in this file and asm_support_x86_64.S. Thanks.
