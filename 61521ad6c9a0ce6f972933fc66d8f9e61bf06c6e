relative paths are a problem when code is moved.

using the library solves the other users cc vs cpp annoyance as well.

but i'm not sure this explains the build issues we've seen, the relative path to code itself doesn't obviously cause a build race to me.

The reason why I think this is the case is there are number of executables that want to build the same file and at some point .o file could be empty or corrupted by different build thread.

might want to use += instead of := --- iirc bdc prefers that style so he doesn't have to worry about where he adds additional += lines for any given variable.

actually, that is enh's preference. but I agree, its a little safer than assuming you are first to set it, though that is pretty clear here that no ones else has messed with it since CLEAR_VARS
