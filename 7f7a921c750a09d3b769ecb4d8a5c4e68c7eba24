This pattern is restricted and won't apply to inner classes. Bytecode is allowed to have IPUTs on this before the call, and that's how the "outer this" is implemented, usually.

If you change it to be more general, you'll have to split the IPutOnThis matcher, as the early ones *are* visible and can't be eliminated if there's another later store...
