How's this hack? It seemed slightly cleaner than JNI calls into ART internals.

Presumably this starts up a separate JVM each time, so I can't do any damage if I was wrong about the initial process state?  There doesn't seem to be any way to retrieve the state from Java.

Not sure if that works, you probably need to wait after the GC since they heap trim is delayed around 5s.
