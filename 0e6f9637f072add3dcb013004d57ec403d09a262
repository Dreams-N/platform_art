We don't use GCC any more. These should probably be "clang" instead. Alternatively, you can set the frame-larger-than value to something higher. The values there are just a heuristic, so perhaps you are only off by a few bytes (and it isn't worth hacking up this code, when you can just relax the threshold a bit).

Clang understands this #pragma even if it's aimed at GCC. And we are actually still using GCC for some targets but that should soon be history. Anyway, this is a debugging CL that should never be submitted.
