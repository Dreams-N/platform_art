Nit: Would you mind not moving the file so we do not have merge conflicts on existing CLs? :-)  However, I agree the code belongs there.  I want to move it there at some point.  I would like to chop it to smaller pieces at the same time as well.  We can bikeshed about naming at some point.

Give that out is a pointer, what's the benefit of &&?

It doesn't really matter. Do you want this passed by value?

Do you plan to use this independently as well? (i.e. not in a flow like Start/StarRoData/.../End). Otherwise why bother make them distinct and public?. For the user of this class as single Write() method seems cleaner.

Yes, using them independently is the plan. Well, at least for the .rodata at the moment, but if I put the rest of it (.text, .bss, etc.) together it will look very inconsistent.

And, if we were somehow running out of memory when writing the debug info, we could move the method_infos and patch_locations out of the OatWriter and destroy the OatWriter to reclaim some memory before calling WriteDebugInfo(), WritePatchLocations().

Is there a reason to put it to temp variable first?

Is the parameter just for verification?
