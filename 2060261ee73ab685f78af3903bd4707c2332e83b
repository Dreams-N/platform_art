Any reason why not just "vios << std::flush" ? The extra * just seems to add noise.

Do you want to change the parameter type to a reference?

Why is this using a forwarding reference?

None of the built-in operator<< in basic_ostream are using that.

  const T& rhs  

should be sufficient, isn't it?

I am not sure I understand the value in ever having operator<< parameter get moved-from, like that would somehow make printing faster (which is a read-only operation)?

The intent of this operator is to forward parameters, so I would be suspicious if I saw "const T&" here.
