Without this `using`, `vixl::aarch64::` becomes very invasive.
I felt this might be an acceptable trespassing:
- The `using` is in the namespace `art::arm64`, so does not leak out to other backends.
- ARM64 code including this header likely will deal with code-generation and also use VIXL.
Does it sound reasonable to you? Up to you.
