Should we have the same static_assert here, too?

You mean, the one from lines 4268â€“4270? It is a bit redundant, as it is a static_assert.  On the other hand, it's inexpensive, as it's a static_assert, and it is good to keep it close to the offset computation (e.g., if one copy and paste code).

I've added it in PS8 (here and in the x86-64 code generator).
