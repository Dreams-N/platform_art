This isn't really bottom. Maybe just say that by lack of proper type infrastructure, we use inexact Object as bottom.

I'm not convinced this is better than the previous dual implementation. Now we've just made it harder to reason on an individual case.

I don't mind either way but I would slightly side with this single implementation. Following the code path to each individual case isn't that difficult, it gets rid of duplicity and completely gets rid of the logic inside BoundTypeForIfInstanceOf.
