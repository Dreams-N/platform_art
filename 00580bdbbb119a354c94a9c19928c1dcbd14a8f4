LoadClass is always going to be a PrimNot, why would it have failed?

Here it should be V0, not A0 (as in MIPS32).

But the actual failure was caused by the bug in the other part of this change, 64-bit field set was failing because the 64-bit value input wasn't in the right registers (for the purpose of alignment on 32-bit architectures, the 64-bit set has a different order of parameters compared to 8/16/32-bit sets).
