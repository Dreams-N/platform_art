I might keep a comment like the removed one for this as well: "// Needs to be before since it accesses the runtime."

we have been moving away from this type of typedef'ing. I'm not sure if that is good or bad, looking for others opinions.

Once upon a time I did actually have one for a vector of dex files but it was removed at one point to improve readability. I used to follow google3 like style of always having a typedef for containers like this, but slowly over time those have been removed as well.
