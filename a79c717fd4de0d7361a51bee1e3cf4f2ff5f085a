shouldn't we keep the test to see if right behavior occurs? at the very least, it breaks the testing numbering when removed :-)

The skipped number tickles my OCD too, I wish the tests had names :) Ok, I've changed it to test that the second load gets removed.

Btw, this CL does not fully solve b/22538329 (as referenced in the LSE source) because ArraySets can still have the wrong input type if the value is a constant:

  float[] array = foo();
  array[0] = 42.0

That's why I haven't removed the b/22538329 workaround yet... Will do that in a follow-up CL.
