We have too many styles for the ternary operator. Can we stick to a few? Such as putting the '?' and ':' at the beginning of the lines with kMax*ShiftDistance?

I think I've used this style (where the line is broken after an operator) following Nicolas's recommendations for a while now.

Should we make an exception for the ?: operator?

No my recommendation is the '?' and ':' on a new line. That's the style I follow. Apologies if there has been some confusion?

For this CL, I've changed the style to "break before the operator" for `?:`, but I've kept the "break after the operator" for other operators in PS3.

The ternary operator is special. For all other operators we indeed break after the operator.

We don't need this anymore, it is always int32_t.

Right; good catch!  Fixed in PS2.
