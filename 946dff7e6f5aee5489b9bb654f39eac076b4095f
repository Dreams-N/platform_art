We have too many styles for the ternary operator. Can we stick to a few? Such as putting the '?' and ':' at the beginning of the lines with kMax*ShiftDistance?

I think I've used this style (where the line is broken after an operator) following Nicolas's recommendations for a while now.

Should we make an exception for the ?: operator?

No my recommendation is the '?' and ':' on a new line. That's the style I follow. Apologies if there has been some confusion?

We don't need this anymore, it is always int32_t.
