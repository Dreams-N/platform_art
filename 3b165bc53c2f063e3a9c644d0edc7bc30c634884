A helper for implementations, but the scheme doesn't work for all of them.

I also don't understand why there's a second one and you just don't include that class in JNIMacroAssembler.

Clean base class. Not all JNI assemblers were forwarding to a simple, well-known regular assembler. E.g, the old arm32 one distinguished itself between arm & thumb (to factor out common code).

Can you point me to the code that can't just extend JNIMacroAssembler? I'm still confused by your explanation.

Oh, you mean the other way around? Of course they all can - and then they all duplicate the part this delegate implements.

If I or ImgTec get around to it and translate Mips assemblers, with the move to vixl32 everything would be a Fwd, so we could then merge this back into the base class.
