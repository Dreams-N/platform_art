why is this happening in constant folding and not in instruction simplifier? same as with the other ops which don't really fold constants?

This is to handle cases like `(var | -1) + 1`.
I think at the time I immplemented this constant folding was only ran before simplification. Now we have multiple occurrences of both, so having that in the simplifier would probably yield equivalent results.
