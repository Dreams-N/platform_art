Again, get the GenerateDebugInfo from the options?

Don't think that's where you want things to be. You can have instance of classes before that class is initialized (eg the class is in the initializing state).

This code only get executed if we executed the else part of the previous if statement (success is true only in that case). In that scenario line 3902 sets the status of the class to kStatusInitialized so I assume it have to be initialized but I might be wrong.

If this isn't the right location to communicate the debug info about the newly loaded class then where should we put it?
