Please expand based on our findings: SSA builder can create typed phi equivalents. So we can end up with a PrimVoid phi and a PrimNot phi equivalent. We should not unconditionaly set the the here, because we may make a PrimNot to PrimInt transition, which is unsupported in our implementation logic.
