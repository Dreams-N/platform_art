This was specifically to preserve clinit semantics: if the load class needs to do the clinit, it has to happen at where it is.

As this CL shows, we need to do the same for the load class semantics.

So the only optimization we can do is: if the load class happens just before the call, we know the call will do the loading. So we can remove it.
