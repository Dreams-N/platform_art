As discussed offline, but I already had this written, so posting it anyway...

Careful with this. Stack maps are always ordered by native PCs, except for methods with try/catch when you have normal stack maps first, followed by catch-point stack maps also ordered by native PCs (i think).

What this means is:
(a) You don't need to do a generic sort - you could simply find the start of the second list and scan two lists linearly.

(b) There may be both a normal and a catch stack map for a given native PC. You're using a stable sort so you'll never confuse the two. Good, but please explain why you need that.
