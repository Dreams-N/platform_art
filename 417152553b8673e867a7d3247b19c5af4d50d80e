Yikes! I appreciate the assembly expertise, but please follow what has already been done for ARM: subclass CodeGenerator and block registers the codegen shouldn't use.

Does the x86 have enough registers to do long operations if you block EBX, ESI, EDI, EBP?

Trial and error :-) You can teach the codegen which registers to use and not use.

I'll do that, but personally I think that's the wrong approach. That way you restrict the coverage of the test.

Which way?

In any case, at the moment you need this level of assembly, comes the very relevance of this test.... that we could write in Java.

The way of blocking registers means you're not testing the whole codegen...

And we're still not testing the level of full Java methods, as this still allows you to just push fragments...

I finally got around to trying the alternative, and Mark is right: not enough registers.
