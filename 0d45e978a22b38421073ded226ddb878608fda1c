This change means we do more resolution here than in the verifier/compiler.
true vs manager->GetCompiler()->IsImage()
ie in the old code we only pre-resolve fields/methods for the image. This should help avoid resolution in the verifier/compiler and we have plenty of context here. I'm concerned that this will test the CheckAndClearResolveException code more and thereby introduce bugs.

The sha that added the original code is:

Note I'm unaware of other resolution loops, so this is a behavioral change. That said, as the exception is checked and cleared, bad behavior should be benign.
