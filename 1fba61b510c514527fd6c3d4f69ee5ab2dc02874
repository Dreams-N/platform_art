Put a DCHECK in for same dex file when is_recursive is true. It should be the case as the optimizing compiler forces PIC, but just to be safe, maybe...

Maybe put a TODO here. We should optimize this more, as this can be done by a relative call to the method head.

Maybe put a TODO here. We should optimize this more, as this can be done by a relative call to the method head. Arm64 has a huge range. So this should always be possible with one instruction, avoiding the load.

Maybe put a TODO here. We should optimize this more, as this can be done by a relative call to the method head. (x86  isn't under a lot of memory pressure, though, but has enough displacement in the relative call.)
