I think we should exercise R6 instructions as well (in general, not just LL and SC), maybe in another CL.  Perhaps we could split the existing AssemblerMIPSTest class in two subclasses?

Roland, in Alexey's defense, there currently isn't a place to put the MIPS32R6 tests. That place is being created by CL 209230. If Alexey's CL gets merged first, I'll add the ll/sc tests to CL 209230.

If CL 209230 gets merged first, Alexey is welcome to get my R6 ll/sc tests from me (which I have already tested in my private build tree), and add them to this patch, or, if he prefers, to write his own version of the tests, and add them to this CL. Or the tests could be added in a third CL as you have mentioned.

Really, we're trying to do the right thing here! :-)

No worries.  And thanks for extending the assembler tests to R6!
