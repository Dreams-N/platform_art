This is copied straightforwardly from the code just below. Doesn't look like we like SOA here...

I think the issue is that it can rely on assembly implementations for memcpy, and we seem to want to avoid them. This is all just moved code...

Brings up the question of correctness. I don't think the naive loops are correct, we're just lucky. Follow-up CL...

Normal style is to put { on line above I think.

We have both in the code base, but majorly your suggestion. Will do.
