I don't think RosAllocSpace/RosAlloc::SetFootprintLimit() modifies the memory inside the mem map. But DlMalloc might. Since we now use the part of the dlmalloc-based non-moving space, rather than the rosalloc-based main space, as the zygote space, this wasn't a problem before CL 90463. Is this right?
