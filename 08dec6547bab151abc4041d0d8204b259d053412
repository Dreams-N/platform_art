Ah thanks much for this test (please add this in the future right away to give me the chance to look smarter :-). I thought the concern was the trip count with dynamic bce, but this is a case were dominator-based bce using a test inside the loop is overlooked indeed while moving out.

This was done for dynamic bce (using dom all back edges), but it indeed looks we overlooked the static case.

Is it important increment by 1? If not you can speed-up the test in case it passes a lot.
