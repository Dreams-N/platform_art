Andreas told me off-line he would be more comfortable if I don't just read the specs and conclude the access checks should precede null check, but actually run the RI to confirm. This requires me trying to hack the same bytecode using my very old friend Jasmin first so I can confirm. Stay tuned while I try to do that.....

Isn't there some "reverse dx" tool for dex bytecode -> Java bytecode translation?

Is there? I only know Jasmin (similar to smali, but for .class), which was sufficient in this case. But I would love to hear about more tools.

I think I heard about such a tool a long time ago but I don't remember it anymore.
