Could you do these checks at the end of the method instead?

Ah, I wasn't sure if reporting the soft failures before hard failing was essential or not. If it is not, I prefer that solution too!

The verifier requires that there are no soft failures reported after hard failures.

The move is fine in this context (I considered suggesting it to get rid of the flag, but thought it didn't matter too much, especially since you'll get a complicated condition on line 4564), as the hard failures return early.
