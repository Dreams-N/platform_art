Sorry, I was following the style of Android.build.mk

Should it be prefixed there with ART_ as well?

What Android.build.mk ?

The name being pretty generic, it's prone to clashes with other .mk helpers.

Why is that called cmdline?

Yes, good catch, I originally called this build-art-cmdline-executable but then noticed it would be more useful as a general-purpose executable builder function. Need to rename local vars to match.

I'm not sure I understand.

The existing convention I tried my best to follow was:

* each binary gets its own top level directory (dex2oat, patchoat, oatdump, and now imgdiag)
* each test goes into the same directory as what its testing, with _test.cc as the file suffix

Can you elaborate the ask please?

Sure :)

The imgdiag is not something we are going to ship, so I find it cleaner to have it under a tools directory. (oatdump should somewhat also be there, but it's closely related to dex2oat, so....).

Actually I am more worried about the "not something we are going to ship". Since I haven't done anything special to the makefiles , it will always be built right now. 

If this is a highly desirable goal then:

How do you recommend filtering it to not "always ship"? We could filter by target variant, or it could only build with NDEBUG=false (but then that version will be slower since its less optimized). Or..?

------

As for moving it under tools, that seems straight forward and happy to move imgdiag and oatdump into art/tools if nobody else has an objection with that.

This test is failing right now on host because we don't have permissions to read /proc/kpagestats but it passes fine on device (since it adb roots first).

Do we want to petition the build team to add grant our tests extra permissions? Make this test device-only? Something else?
