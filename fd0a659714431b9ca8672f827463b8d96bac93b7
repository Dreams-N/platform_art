I am not 100% if this works, and also not sure if this works after you already made this CL, but if you can use git cp on the register_allocator_linear.h file to this file (and same for .cc), then the diff of what you moved up (and what you changed in the process would be a little easier to read). Is that still doable?

I don't think we use this order in header files. The only comes-first rule I am aware of is that in x.cc, we include x.h first...
