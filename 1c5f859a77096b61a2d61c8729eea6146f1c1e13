So could you make this a helper in DexFile ?

How about we move all this logic to CodeGenerator? And just pass method_ptr/code_ptr to HInvokeStaticOrDirect. This would also nicely move all the new enums intriduced in nodes.h to CodeGenerator.

Compile-time point in case: there's no need to do all this logic if the invoke is actually dead code. I know the compiler driver is also doing it, but that's also something I'd like to see cleaned up.

Because Label is not used by vixl, we are templatizing the CommonGetLabel method in this file. Could we do the same here?
