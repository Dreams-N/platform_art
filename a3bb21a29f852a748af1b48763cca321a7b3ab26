I know that this is copy paste, but why is the extract only reference here?

A class SHALL NOT be defined twice in a dex file. Class definition's items SHALL refer to field and method ids with class_idx_ of that class.

Given that we shard on class definitions, this is enough; however, we would be fine even if sharding on method definitions because we also forbid unordered method definitions in a class def, filter out duplicates within "direct" and "virtual" and forbid the same method index in both "direct" and "virtual".
