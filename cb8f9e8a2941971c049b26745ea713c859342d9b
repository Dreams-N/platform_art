What does "coincide" mean in this context? "are the same"? 
An example (or pointer to somewhere that has an example) of each in the comment would improve readability.

Yes, that's the meaning. For normal APKs, the location is the name/place of the jar file. For multidex APKs, we need a way to distinguish the zipped up dex files. So the second/third/... dex files get an "extended" or "synthetic" location, like x.jar:classes2.dex. To look for resources, we need to look into x.jar, that's what this change is about.

Once Calin is back, I would like him to take a look at it, as he had done refactoring before. If he is OK with it, I'll push a small cleanup CL to fix the comment.
