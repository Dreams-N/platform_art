Why this change? I plan on moving this to a shared header:https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/102100/.

It seemed reasonable to put this into Mir2Lir, as it seemed the only user. The overall change is because I moved the constants to the cc file for easy adjustment, so it's not constexpr anymore.

Because it fails for the optimizing compiler and hangs. It seems you're not creating a stack frame, or a very small one?

Hmm. I'd rather you keep the code and mark it as black listed than commenting a test. I dont want quick and interpreter to lose some coverage.

OK, I'll push another CL. I was remembering your comment of missing checks in the optimizing compiler, and thought it should expose that it's actually working correctly in some cases already. :-)
