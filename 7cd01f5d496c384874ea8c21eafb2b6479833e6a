In the future, I'd really like to see those tests in a separate run-test. There's some things in this file that the optimizing compiler can't and can handle. For the ones that it can, having a dedicated test adds the benefit of testing all our compilers.

Also, a dedicated one easily tells us what is failing in case of a regression.
