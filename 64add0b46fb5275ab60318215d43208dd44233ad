This may be controversial and not fully needed for this CL. It is a copy of the LLVM file so that the master-art-host manifest file does not have llvm and friends and dependencies. Makes its checkout and compilation of art much faster.

If you're unsure about this, I can move it to a different CL where we can discuss about it.

I'd rather move to using the bionic/glibc elf.h for the runtime/elf_file.* and then just add local definitions for anything we are using from LLVM for the runtime part.

For the elf_writer, similarly I'd like to use elf.h for the quick part. If the mclinker version need's LLVM's elf.h, that is fine as a local dependency.

but yes, it can be a separate CL.
