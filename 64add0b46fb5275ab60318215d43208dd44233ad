This may be controversial and not fully needed for this CL. It is a copy of the LLVM file so that the master-art-host manifest file does not have llvm and friends and dependencies. Makes its checkout and compilation of art much faster.

If you're unsure about this, I can move it to a different CL where we can discuss about it.
