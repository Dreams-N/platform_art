Is using a bool necessary for future work? I think the current approach could be done by just using a Class return value.

Yes, it is currently necessary. How do you handle the situation: PathClassLoader -> SomethingSomething -> BootClassLoader? You either have to actually run the Java code for SomethingSomething, which is a larger refactor (though could be done) or report that it is *not* valid to look for the class in the PathClassLoader.
