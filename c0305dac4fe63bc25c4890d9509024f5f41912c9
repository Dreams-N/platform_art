Before as in "in the past".

The symbolizer creates a copy of the given oat file with symbols added into it.
Due to oversight we would copy 64-bit ELF file into 32-bit ELF file.
As far as my git archaeology tells me this was always the case.
I have touched this file many times, and have never noticed.  I feel bad.
