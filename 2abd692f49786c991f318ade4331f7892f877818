If the use is before current->GetStart(), it must be env and should be skipped instead of getting a location. Seems to me that's a possible case. And the same assert on line 1521 should apply.

I don't think this can happen. We're iterating over the siblings, and the siblings cover the ranges where the instruction is used. So this takes care of environment uses within that range. The only other environment uses are after that range and are checked line 1521.
