No it does not break test-art-host.

It's empty today because we pass all tests. But it might be that adding a new test will break it, and it should not be on the test writer to figure out why. So this variable is where he should add this test.

Thinking about it, I'll try to add an error message in the Makefile to document this intent when a test fails.
