Loading classes implies that thread suspension is possible, I'd assert that if this is true then allow thread suspension is also true.

I was thinking about this before, but is that really true? I mean this worked before you added thread suspension. Isn't it more like: when one verifier does something that allows to load classes, then every other should allow suspension?
