I guess we could refactor InvokeRuntimeWithoutRecordingPcInfo using this.

I would add a TODO.

Well... we would need InvokeRuntimeWithoutRecordingPcInfo() to operate on QuickEntrypointsEnum entrypoint, which it does not. Or do you have something else in mind?

What we could do is remove the InvokeRuntimeWithoutRecordingPcInfo() and at its use points (one per backend) have what it expands to. Can't say that that is better then what we have.

Right, I forgot that InvokeRuntimeWithoutRecordingPcInfo was taking an offset as argument.  We can leave things as is for now.
