I think you need kNoOutputOverlap to ensure that input 1 isn't in RSI already, otherwise you may clobber it when loading RSI below.

Done, but the correct constant in this case is kOutputOverlap because we want the liveness of the input and output registers to overlap, in which case the input registers cannot be clobbered.
