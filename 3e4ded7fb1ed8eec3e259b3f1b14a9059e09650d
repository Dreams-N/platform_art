I do not understand this. So the resolved method is not the same, it is not null, but it's not copied? When is that supposed to happen? That actually looks like an error situation to me.

We shouldn't be changing the dex_cache to the non-copied version of the method.

What does this mean, non-copied, here?

I am asserting you're masking an error.

As an aside I found an unrelated bug. If you have a large amount of uptime your pid_ts can get >65536 which causes this to fail.

We should maybe deal with this since it will almost certainly happen on the buildbots (it took only 12 days of uptime on my workstation to hit this and fixing it required a reboot).

You didn't find this bug, it's known.
