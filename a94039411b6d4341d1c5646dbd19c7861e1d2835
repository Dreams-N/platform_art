Do you think it is more efficient?
I thought about more complex algorithm. Say check whether deallocation will help to make a pair. for example break of non-aligned pair not definitely helps us to create a pair. If we have ecx,edx pair we always can create edi,edi pair. So no need to break ecx,edx, isn't it?
