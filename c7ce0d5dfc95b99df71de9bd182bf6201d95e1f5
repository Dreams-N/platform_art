Why do we need to hide the exact tests that get run (the "RUN" and the "OK" messages)? I find it informative and it also acts as a safeguard when new test methods get added that they're actually being run.

The color coding on on the "OK" (green) and the "FAILED" (red) also gives back very quick feedback for test driven development.

Quieting the specific tests that are spammy seems like it should be sufficient.

This is only if we specifically pass --quiet or run with ART_TEST_QUIET=true. If you were adding tests you would presumably try running at least once directly for just this reason.

Honestly I didn't put it in since its annoying doing coloring in a terminal and the fact that there is much less output makes it less necessary IMO.

It's run with ART_TEST_QUIET by default isn't it?

If anything, I can only see that disabling ART_TEST_QUIET must happen explicitly.

I actually don't need this.

IIRC for run-test didn't you buffer the output so we could replay it on a test failure?

Why not do the same thing here? Otherwise if it prints anything else out (that's not as a result of EXPECT/ASSERT) we will miss it [in the build logs].

Did you check it on the target too? Some tests might send data to logcat and spam it.
