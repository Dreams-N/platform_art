below you use art_build_path defined above. seems like you should nuke it entirely or use it consistently.

suggestion: you started calling these PREREQ elsewhere, perhaps its better to use that everywhere?

I've used prerequisite when its been phony targets gathering other phony targets, dependency didn't seem literally quite right. I'd like to revisit cleaning that up in a different CL.

its hard to see the delta here (at least on my smalls laptop screen doing diff)

i might but the delta at the end for readability.

The delta is making dalvikvm -> dalvikvm32 and dalvikvm64 with the ordering matching the original ordering. The changed field is the 2nd from the left. I agree these long lines are hard to read and would like to see them split.

the point is to defer evaluation until the result of the eval is being processed.

and the eval seems to be leading to $$$$ which just seems even more confusing. i see this in a lot of other places as well

There are 2 instances of this (the other is in Android.gtest.mk). This instance is in an eval but the other is in shell commands. During development the $$ style is lazier and easier to debug/interpret. I don't think either form is particular good, but I preferred this.
