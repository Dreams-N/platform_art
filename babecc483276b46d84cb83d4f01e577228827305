Yes,

collector_type_ has the default set in XGcOption constructor
background_collector_type has the default set in BackgroundGcOption constructor
interpreter_only has the default set in runtime_options.def

Basically primitives have their defaults set directly in runtime_options.def and everything else is in the default constructor of the type.

We could do it all in runtime_options.def but then the default values become many lines instead of 1 line, and T{} no longer reflects defaults which seems counter-intuitive. Either way is fine with me.
