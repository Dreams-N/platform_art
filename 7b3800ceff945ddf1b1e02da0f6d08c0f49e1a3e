he means old dalvik style odex files, not art files.

this is a standard Android makefile, but I am sure you guys prefer to Art-i-fy this one....

You may want to look into oatdump or dex2oat or dalvikvm, and see how we generally try to set up things.

The main thing is that we really like our selection of CFLAGS etc, which are quite a bit stronger than most of the rest of the tree, and automatically set up if you reuse our functions...

But I'd be fine if that was done in a follow-up.

Note that this file is kept as close to the original /dalvik/dexdump/DexDump.cpp as possible. Unfortunately, git does not allow a cp to preserve the diff (and it is too soon for a git mv).

Maybe a PS1 with the original version and a PS2 for your changed version might help the review?

This part should be in parentheses, as that's not what's going on on device. :-)

Using that as source means you need to be careful with expectations of where this test will succeed. Standard preopt targets (e.g., all "unfixed" emulators [only mips64], all user or WITH_DEXPREOPT builds) will remove the dex file from the jar (as it's already in the odex).

I guess somebody fixed the linter for this (and below)? Not too long ago (maybe half a year) I think it would have complained on this.

I think this should be on the previous line, it keeps the Exec call together and better readable IMHO. It's pretty common for us to break CHECKs and LOGs before the <<.
