why the change from std::unique_ptr?

don't you have to release it now?

it did LOG(FATAL) before, right?

specificially:

LOG(FATAL) << "Failed to find dalvik-cache directory " << dalvik_cache;

so it seems like it should do that if abort_on_error?

No. Please look at the original code. All aborts are predicated on create_if_absent. Somebody might have screwed up braces once, but as-is...

This is actually not semantics-preserving, though. I would need to return dalvik_cache instead.

That's why I did not want to refactor before and only tried for Seb.
