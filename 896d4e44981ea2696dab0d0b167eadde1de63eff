we used to have stuff like this and I ripped it out in favor of passing via the compiler-option below. I really believe that the running process should know what it is from its own context and dex2oat should be getting it via its own command line options

fwiw, its useful when adding member variables like this to have a description of what the meaning is. Here instruction_set_ is holding the desired instruction set for forked dex2oat processes - that's not implied by the variable's name. As Andreas mentioned, explaining why this isn't just a constant would also be useful.

Sure. Brian & I decided to rework this design somewhat, so this change isn't needed any more. I'll keep this in mind for the future though.
