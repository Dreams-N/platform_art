Aesthetics: the code suggests that LoadBaseIndexed() can handle size == kReference, but this is not true. I would do a

  case kReference: LOG(FATAL) << "Invalid usage of ...";

(as you suggested in your previous comment) and use k32 in LoadRefIndexed(). After all, the real handling of kReference is done in LoadRefIndexed() rather than here.
