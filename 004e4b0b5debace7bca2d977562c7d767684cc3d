We could still do the transformation in this case.
We would end up with MOV+BIC, which is as good as NOT+AND.

Yes indeed. [Following offline discussion] Since it doesn't improve the code either in this case, we can leave it like that for now, until a later change that also applies the transformation to arm32 (in which case it is much simpler to always do the transformation).
