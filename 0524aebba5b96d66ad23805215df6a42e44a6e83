Is there a better way for me to figure out what image we need for 'art', rather than hard-coding it? Should the 'art' script have a dependency on the image it uses?

The reasons we moved to using that image is:
1) Optimizing is now the main compiler
2) The perf tool does not work with non-PIC oat files.

I think the art script currently only has a dependency on its file. Fine by me if we make it depend on the image (and then probably all the dalvikvm/dex2oat so that it works out of the box).
