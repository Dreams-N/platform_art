You don't need this at all. You're copying only actual data and you don't even care about alignment as ART is always running with SCTRL.A=0. If you did care about alignment, you would have to deal with unaligned srcBegin/dstBegin.

I am curious about this. I understand a runtime check is jucky and all, but ldm/stm with two registers is as fast as ldr/str AFAIK. Reserving another temp (or maybe destroying the receiver register, it's probably dead) shouldn't be the end of the world.

I'm curious what the code would look like when embedded into a method. Can you make any comments about the quality from experiments?
