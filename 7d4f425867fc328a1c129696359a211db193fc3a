I think that if it's a dependency of the elf format, I would just switch in this method instead of making it a template.

Style is const reference for arguments. If you need to change the data, don't make it const.

Just chatted with Brian, I'm referencing:

"Remember that most of the time input parameters are going to be specified as const T&. Using const T* instead communicates to the reader that the input is somehow treated differently. So if you choose const T* rather than const T&, do so for a concrete reason; otherwise it will likely confuse readers by making them look for an explanation that doesn't exist."

So you can use it, but it lead to confusion.
