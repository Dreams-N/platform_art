I think that if it's a dependency of the elf format, I would just switch in this method instead of making it a template.

I don't know what you mean. We would need to have everything twice to 'switch it in the method'. Using a template we don't need to repeat ourselves.

What I mean is: What is the reason we have to differentiate between the two types? Is that because of the ELF format, or is that because we think it's nicer to be 64 in 64bits and 32 in 32bits.

You wouldn't need to repeat yourself either without a template. You probably can sense I'm not a big fan of templates.

Its part of ELF mostly. The problem was I was assuming this would always be sizeof(uintptr_t) which is bad. 

Also I agree templates are icky but in this case I think the benefits outweigh the cons.

Style is const reference for arguments. If you need to change the data, don't make it const.

Just chatted with Brian, I'm referencing:

http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml

"Remember that most of the time input parameters are going to be specified as const T&. Using const T* instead communicates to the reader that the input is somehow treated differently. So if you choose const T* rather than const T&, do so for a concrete reason; otherwise it will likely confuse readers by making them look for an explanation that doesn't exist."

So you can use it, but it lead to confusion.
