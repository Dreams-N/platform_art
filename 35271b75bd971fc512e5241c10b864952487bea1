The natural counterpart for LoadConstantWide is LoadConstantNoClobber. See TODO before the LoadConstantWide implementation in utility_arm64.cc. This shouldn't have a real effect here, but I think is worth revising the names. Also, for Arm64 LoadConstantNoClobber will automatically call LoadConstantWide, if the input RegLocation is wide. This means that here you could just use a LoadConstant().
