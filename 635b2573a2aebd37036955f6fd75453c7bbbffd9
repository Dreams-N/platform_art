Why adding this? Can't we get fetch it from the method instead?

We can probably get the number N of dex registers used in a (whole) method from the method itself, but the highlighted setting is a per-stack map value, meaning it can be different for each stack map (I only encountered cases where this number of dex registers was either N or 0 though).  Is there a way to get this information from the method?

As discussed offline, we probably don't need to save the number of saved registers per stack map, by using a special value (say 0 or -1) for the DexRegisterMapOffset field.

Native methods have no GC map. I think you also need to know the method is not native.

This shouldn't be an issue, as native methods should have a vmap offset equal to zero in the `oat_method' object, meaning `raw_code_info' would be null; thus vmap data would not be inspected for such methods.
