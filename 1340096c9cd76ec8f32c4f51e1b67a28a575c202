Should this maybe be m->GetInterfaceMethodIfProxy ?

Not sure what would happen if you tried to return an interface method, maybe it would just break everything else.

But that's probably better than returning a proxy method here.

nit: This just seems like the usual path taken, despite the LIKELY on 77

IMHO it should be more like

  if (UNLIKELY(m->IsDefault()) { 
     ....
     return
  }

  return m;

For my understanding: we are interpreting a default method of an interface I on an object of type C implementing I.
What is the given ArtMethod 'm': is it I.m or C.m ?

Looking at this change, it seems to me it is C.m which is a copy of I.m + the kDefault flag. Am I right?

The copy idiom is error-prone: FindFirstBreakpointForMethod also does pointer comparison, then should be updated too.
