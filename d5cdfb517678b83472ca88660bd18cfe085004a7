It's always nice to say a few words what exactly was clean-up. 

- good for history 
- easier to follow the evolution
- easier to review since you know what to expect (at least for starters :) )

since these are fields I find "Temporary" a bit misleading. (i.e. What makes them temporary?)

(similar for the other cases)
