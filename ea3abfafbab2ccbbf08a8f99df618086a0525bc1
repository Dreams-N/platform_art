Can we stop calling things Data, I've moaned about Vlad doing this. Data is not intention revealing, I'd expect any data structure by definition to contain data. I don't know why people keep feeling a need to munge disparate data together. By doing this it hides why we care about information and introduces false dependencies - see the dex compilation unit for a similar turd. If the visitors care about having a reference back to the CatchFinder, why aren't we giving them a reference back to the CatchFinder?
