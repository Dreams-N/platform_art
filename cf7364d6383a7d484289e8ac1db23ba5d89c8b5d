Please either rename this (if you'd want to keep the checks in after a fix), or put it into its own CL (so after fixing you can properly revert it).

I don't want to keep the checks in after a fix. They access internal implementation details they ought not to be accessing.

If I put it into another commit, to properly revert the diagnostics code, both that commit and f16d5727 should be reverted.

I'll move the diagnostics info into its own CL.
