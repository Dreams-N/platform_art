Maybe a question for Nicolas. If it's not a slow path only safepoint, do we need to add to safepoints_ here? I thought live registers are only meaningful for slow path only safepoint.

Can you assert here that adjacent->GetInterval()->IsFixed()?

There are cases where a pre-colored interval is not "fixed". For example,  I split an interval just after a fixed register def and assign the parent interval a register, but the interval itself is not marked as fixed.
Perhaps I can clear this up in my next CL by changing adjacent->GetInterval()->HasRegister() to adjacent->IsPrecolored().
