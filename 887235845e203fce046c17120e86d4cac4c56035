usage is out of date, perhaps

": override ANDROID_ROOT when looking for the boot image."

android_root is used throughout the compiler, elf writer... Previously we were unconditionally setting it in the case of boot.art and I think that was a mistake as the GetAndroidRoot code is in effect being executed to set up android_root, except that logic also allows for the command line override. I don't follow the previous usage message and making this specific to the case of the boot image also doesn't seem right. For context, this change is necessary for the "oat-target" build dependency to work.

when this was written, it really was only used for portable backend linking (aka mclinker).

I only looked at the diff, I didn't see that had creeped into use elsewhere. I just want it to be accurate, and it definitely is not now.

it's fine to just simply say

": used to specify the Android root location, typically for compiling on the host"

or something similar.

Shouldn't we call GetAndroidRoot() here?

GetAndroidRoot is fatal, which won't work here.

all it would by is defaulting to /system if it exists and on device ANDROID_ROOT=/system.

Ok, didn't realize it was fatal.
