It's not that easy. This is UNIMPLEMENTED(FATAL) for Mips32.

Perhaps not but the only references I can find to "AsInvokeVirtual" are in the following files:

./art/compiler/optimizing/intrinsics_utils.h
./art/compiler/optimizing/intrinsics_mips.cc
./art/compiler/optimizing/intrinsics_mips64.cc
./art/compiler/optimizing/intrinsics_arm64.cc

I searched through all of the instances of "UNIMPLEMENTED(FATAL)" but didn't see anything which looked relevant.

Please point me to a working implementation of "AsInvokeVirtual" which I can use as a template.

Thanks.

AsInvokeVirtual is not the problem (it's basically just a down_cast). It's the GenerateVirtualCall which is missing.
