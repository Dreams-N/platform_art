do we have numbers here? are we actually seeing precision issues because of this? I'd assume that's not relevant.

I don't have numbers, but the test case added to test/422-type-conversion/src/Main.java, which passes on x86 (thanks to https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/146692/), x86-64 and ARM64, now also passes on ARM with this change.

Oki, I see the context now. Does the precision gain worth going to runtime? My intuition says that no.

Also, should we be more tolerant in the tests maybe? What if we update the code to even more precise results? The current way of testing doesn't seem right in this new light.

This was experimental code intended for another CL, sorry.  Removed.
