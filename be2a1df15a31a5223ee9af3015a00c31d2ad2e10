This is fine as a literal translation.  But there may be a performance opportunity here on ARM.  Do we rely elsewhere on the fact there is a fence here?  My guess is that (maybe) ThreadFenceForConstructor() followed by a relaxed operation is both cheaper and a better indication of the intent?  I don't understand the constraints well enough ...
