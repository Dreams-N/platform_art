I believe we can go up to d31 following this change. There will need to be changes to:
Runtime::CreateCalleeSaveMethod - change the fp spill mask there to be doubles rather than singles
ArmContext::FillCalleeSaves - fprs_ should be 64bit and the loop over kNumberOfDRegisters rather than SRegisters
SETUP_SAVE_ALL_CALLEE_SAVE_FRAME - should vpush double rather than single registers for callee saves for the exception throw long jump
art_quick_do_long_jump - the vldm should load double rather than single registers
