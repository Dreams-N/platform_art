This is broken (my fault - it was also previously broken).  A recent revision of the RegStorage encoding which moved the FP bit failed to update this code.  A core register should set a corresponding bit in 0..31, while a fp reg should set in 32..63.  Before the RegStorage encoding update, this code achieved that.  Now, we'll need something like what's done in x86's GetRegMaskCommon().

Should this be

  (reg.IsFloat() ? kArm64FPReg0 : 0) + reg.GetRegNum())

or do we need to take the StorageSize() into account as on X86_64?

Yes -
  (reg.IsFloat()....
looks good.  No, we don't need to take StorageSize() into account (at least until arm64 starts using vector registers for non-floating point purposes).
