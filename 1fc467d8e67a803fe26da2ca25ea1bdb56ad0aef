I strongly wonder whether this should go into LinkCode and FixupTrampolines, i.e., into NeedsInterpreter.

That is considering how we do instrumentation already - we still have the oat class accessible, but linking diverts to the interpreter.

It may be a better point to keep those things in one point instead of two.

(The "benchmark" would still be basically valid, just down the line...)

Yeah, you're suggesting to rename NeedsInterpreter to CanUseAOTCode? I would agree.
