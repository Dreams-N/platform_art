Can you reinstate the old code, including kBootImageLinkTimePcRelative, please? With the exception of the "MIPS" from the comments, since MIPS64 remains the only architecture where these are unimplemented.

Note that the address is unused for both load kinds.

Yes, there has been a weird bug on flounder that I've been trying to debug for a while if I add PcRelative back in. I'm trying to find it, but wanted to add this in for now since this case is working.

Ah yes, that was from testing another option. Will take it out.
