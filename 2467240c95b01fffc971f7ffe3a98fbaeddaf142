Why only on x64? This looks odd if triggered by this change. I don't see why GVN would replace an constant int with a null.

Could you move this to its own change with a small unit test?

Since this could also apply to non commutative inputs, maybe move the constant logic to a helper in HBinaryOperation that will be used by something like prepare_for_register_allocation.cc.
