This is also a question for myself. Do we need to clear those arena vectors/sets? Seems to me not necessary since the real memory are allocated from arena.
If it's necessary, maybe add another method like CleanUp/Finish() instead of calling those clear() in FixSSA().

We don't need to clear for memory reasons, but to me it felt right that after the phi nodes are constructed, we no longer keep the deopt information around (so if you would use this instance again, new deopt blocks would result).

I have done the renaming of the method.
