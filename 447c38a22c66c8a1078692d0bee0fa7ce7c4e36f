It would be nice to turn this into something more like, "IsSmallMethod(GetNumDalvikInsns())" and bury things like small_method_threshold_. I don't mind this change as a step in that direction.

Its this kind of thing in the current code that upsets me. We are we dividing a number of instructions by 2 and then comparing to a count of basic blocks? Its an approximate thing but we should be detailing why 2 (do we expect just 2 instructions per basic block), etc. and I'd prefer if this was done in a vain like above where we go "IsTooManyBasicBlocks(num_blocks_)" although that would have no purpose being more global than to quick.
Given this code isn't being used in anger I see that the point of being in this code was just to clean-up the options from Runtime to CompilerOptions. I'm just commenting for the sake of future clean-up, but may be the best thing to do then is just to get rid of this code.

I'm kind of put off by reference fields like this. I like that they capture non-nullness, but they seem to more poorly capture the notion of ownership than a pointer - which is say hey somebody else owns this don't worry. CompilerOptions could well be stack allocated, so I find this a little scary. Perhaps make it a pointer or add a comment to who the expected owner is. Perhaps there's another way to allay my concerns.

just making the argument a pointer feels simpler to me when we start getting code like this
