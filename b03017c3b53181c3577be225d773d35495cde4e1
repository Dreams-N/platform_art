Maybe use a different method for capturing the information? Do already started threads have no Jni peers anymore?

All started threads have no JNI peer. The JNI peer is only used when starting thread from Java. It is deleted before calling Thread.run method.

However, having a null jpeer doesn't mean the thread is started. From the debugger POV, it just an indication we are still in the process of starting up a thread.

This is really a special case for the debugger so I think we could keep such name. I just prefer to avoid any name related to thread state because this could be confusing about its use. I'm thinking about a better naming. I accept suggestions :)
