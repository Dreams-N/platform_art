I'm not sure this call is required since the ClearWhiteReferences below will dequeue all references enqueue cleared references in the cleared_references_ queue.

I don't think we need this boolean since the preserved callback should be doing all the work to decide which references to preserve.

If we delete the conditional it would be equivalent to always enqueueing in the cleared list. Maybe you can add a way to iterate over the reference queue so that we don't need to enqueue and dequeue?
