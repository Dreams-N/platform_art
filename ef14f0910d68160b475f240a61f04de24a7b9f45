This isn't just a test, you're actually changing LoadConst64(). Name it something like "Improve non-trivial 64-bit constant loading".

Following the renaming of EmitDinsu() to LoadReplicatedConst32(), this should also be renamed.

InstrCountForLoadReplicatedConst32() is a bit long, but is much more descriptive.

(x & 0xFFFF) == 0. And then the whole return statement fits one line.

I don't think this comment adds value.

OTOH, this name is confusing as we already have Dinsu() and the method does more than just that. Rename to LoadReplicatedConst32().

Move further down to between
EmitBcondc()
and
Buncond().

Too cryptic, IMO. It could've been an underscored integer suffix (_1, _2, etc) just as well, not pretending to convey any additional info, which there really isn't. Perhaps the only utility of a name here is to locate a failing test case by its name.

I'd like someone else's (google's) opinion here.

Some 1000+ tests (for a single method) in source code looks excessive. I'm not saying these values shouldn't be tested, though.

I'd like someone else's (google's) opinion here.

I'm not reviewing the following test code.
