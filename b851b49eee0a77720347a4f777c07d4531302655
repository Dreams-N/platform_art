Are you sure the grouping works? What makes you think the things are sorted based on the source file?

The grouping is just for the sake of the debugger so that everything is not in one big table.  This way the debugger can first find the relevant compilation unit(s) based on address and search only those.
The methods do not have to be sorted in any particular source order, and repetitions should be also fine.

The methods have to be somewhat grouped/sorted, otherwise you're likely to get one compilation-unit per method-info.

I just didn't realize this is from the OatWriter, which creates the vector serialized (visiting classes non-multi-threaded). So this is always grouped by class, which then puts all of a class' methods into the same compilation unit...

Is it guaranteed there's one method that isn't marked as deduped?

The first one is not marked and the rest is.
