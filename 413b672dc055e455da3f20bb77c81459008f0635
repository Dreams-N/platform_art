since you have ::Create, this can be private.

I think kRegisterAllocatorDefault should be a const in the optimizing compiler.

Having a "Default" value as part of the enum is not very intuitive and makes you do the test hack in ::Create.

Good point.
In my latest patch set I've put the default as a static member of RegisterAllocator, since I think we still want to access the default without going through the optimizing compiler (e.g., for unit testing). Let me know if that's alright, though.
