The size of the frame did not increase to store the extra spill?  (due to alignment?)

Looks that way. Compare "str d8, [sp, #40]" with "stp d8, d9, [sp, #32]".

184 would not be 16B aligned, so violate our stack alignment (and ARM64's). The old frame was rounded up, and padding is inserted "before" the spills. To note here is that for JNI, the handle-scope is part of the frame.
