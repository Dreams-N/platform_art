Can you please add:

#if defined(__linux__) && defined(__arm__)

this workaround isn't needed for x86, for example.

Just to be clear: We're not disabling ASLR. Rather, we're suppressing subsequent intra-mmap() randomizations. By this point, the base load address of the process has already been randomized.

Can you change the comment to:

"Work around the issue by inhibiting further mmap() randomization."
