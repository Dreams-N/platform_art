Unaligned loads have been removed from r6, right (and load instructions must support non-alignment)? (Note that the addresses here don't have to be aligned.)

From the pages of "The MIPS64 Instruction Set Reference Manual, Revision 6.02" describing LH, LW, LD, SH, SW, and SD:

Release 6 requires systems to provide support for misaligned memory accesses for all ordinary memory reference
instructions. This instruction is considered an ordinary memory reference instruction for the purposes of misalign-
ment: the system must provide a mechanism to complete a misaligned memory reference for this instruction, ranging
from full execution in hardware to trap-and-emulate.
