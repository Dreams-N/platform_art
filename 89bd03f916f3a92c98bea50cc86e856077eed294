It should not create the symlink in general, only for exactly one oat file - the boot.oat. Where did you see other symlinks (that sounds like a bug)?

I do not like you conflating the cases of input-oat-fd and input-oat-gz-fd...

This patch just tries to prevent some errors.
Who knows what build settings are used by others.
Is it impossible to compile apks with --compile-pic?

Any suggestions to not conflate? I thought that having input-oat-gz-fd we can just unzip it to swap-fd then set input-oat-fd=swap-fd as if it was specified by user. I propose to discuss it in the gzip patch (ae0ec6ad7152f12cc116c175aa4c6ff7952bc21c).
