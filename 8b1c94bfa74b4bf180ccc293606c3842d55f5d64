I changed this code since it was causing some dex2oat image writer crashes due to incorrect conflict tables.

Could you tell me how to reproduce dex2oat crash?
I checked your change and found many classes in boot.art where IMT is not shared.
In my version dex2oat works fine for user build for hammerhead.
