I changed this code since it was causing some dex2oat image writer crashes due to incorrect conflict tables.

Could you tell me how to reproduce dex2oat crash?
I checked your change and found many classes in boot.art where IMT is not shared.
In my version dex2oat works fine for user build for hammerhead.

It might happen on latest N preview for angler, I saw it on internal TOT branch.

The current approach is not optimal, but I think if we fill conflicts in the IMT of the super class first, we can reduce most of the duplication.

This is similar to what I had in mind, I think it is not 100% correct for the conflict table case but I have a fix for this.
