Why did you remove the call to tryInlineFloat() (as well as the ones to returnVoid() and returnVoidWithOneParameter()) from test/437-checker-inliner/src/Main.java from PS5?  Was it because these are already assessed by test/437-inline/src/Main.java?  Or maybe because there's no Checker-style annotation for those?
