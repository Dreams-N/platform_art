is there some contract that we are returning false so we should add a message as to why? in this case just noting that we failed to load and fallback is disabled?

At this point error_msgs will already contain some errors, namely those of oat file generation. I guess it's fine to add a top-level one stating that fallback is disabled in an else-branch.

The false is the return code for "couldn't find or generate oat file" according to a comment in DexFile. The actual decision is then made over the content of dex_files. Probably needs a comment in class_linker.h what "false" means.
