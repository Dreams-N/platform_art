This example is a bit confusing, is there an example where the filename has a .dex at the end?

Would you prefer:
  Example: --dex-file=/home/build/out/system/framework/core.jar
           --dex-location=/system/framework/core.jar

That's more consistent with the --dex-file example.
To me, an example ending with .dex is more confusing, because it's not what you usually have.
