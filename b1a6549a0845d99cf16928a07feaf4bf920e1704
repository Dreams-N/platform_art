This example is a bit confusing, is there an example where the filename has a .dex at the end?

Would you prefer:
  Example: --dex-file=/home/build/out/system/framework/core.jar
           --dex-location=/system/framework/core.jar

That's more consistent with the --dex-file example.
To me, an example ending with .dex is more confusing, because it's not what you usually have.

Should we change the --dex-file usage too then?

Or maybe something like this, which lists the typical file extensions:

    specifies a .dex file to compile (also often .jar, .apk)
    Example: ...

The #1 problem as-is is not being sure what file extension goes with which command flag, so we end up digging through source code or look at some examples in runtest
