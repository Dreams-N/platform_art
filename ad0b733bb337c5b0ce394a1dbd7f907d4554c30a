Maybe change to: "Dex file with valid checksum for location ", to hint that there are two failure conditions: 1. the dex location isn't found. 2. the checksum doesn't match.

The cleanup I would like to do for this (not necessarily in this CL) is modify GetOatDexFile to return its error message and include that in the VLOG message.
