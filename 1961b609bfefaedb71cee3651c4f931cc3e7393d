I somewhat dislike this. I understand that currently the packed-switch is the only one using this. But from just "PcRelLoadRA" it is *not* obvious that it must be a SwitchTable (instead of generic EmbeddedData).

The meaning of raw "PcRel" instruction is not well defined on 32-bit x86, it definitely needs some anchor. So, yes, this could use some cleanup but that's out of scope of this CL.
