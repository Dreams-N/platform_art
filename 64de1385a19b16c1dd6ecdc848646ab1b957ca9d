I think this lacks any clear meaning.

I think MethodHelper is a thing for helping with a Method (now known as an ArtMethod). GetMethod seems to have a clear meaning, Get isn't clear. GetMethodIgnoringProxies would be clearer. Why the operator-> is returning GetMethodIgnoringProxies I think isn't clear.

Isn't MethodHelper a thing of the past? It looks like it's being used here and there as a way to avoid dealing with the raw method (and hence we should use handled instead).

Why do we need a handle when the ShadowFrame holds the method? Previously there were more cached fields in MethodHelper, and so avoiding some computation could be worth while. I just see the shorty now :-/

Is the issue that MethodHelper contains a Handle in it and it's used like a Handle in some interpreter code? Maybe we can pass around Handle instead and allocate and use a MethodHelper on the stack only in a small local scope where it's actually needed?
