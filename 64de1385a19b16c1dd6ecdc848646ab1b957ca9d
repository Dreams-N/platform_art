I think this lacks any clear meaning.

I think MethodHelper is a thing for helping with a Method (now known as an ArtMethod). GetMethod seems to have a clear meaning, Get isn't clear. GetMethodIgnoringProxies would be clearer. Why the operator-> is returning GetMethodIgnoringProxies I think isn't clear.
