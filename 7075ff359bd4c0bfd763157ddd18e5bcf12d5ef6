General comment: MIR is already larger than it needs to be.  As the TODO says, we've been planning on reducing its size via removal of the embedded DecodedInstruction.  Adding a bunch of new native pointers is clearly moving in the wrong direction.  Even beyond the footprint issue, I also share Ian's concern about switching a central data structure from a singly to doubly linked list with public access to the links.

What portions of this change do you consider absolutely necessary?  For example, instead of adding a backlink to the containing basic block could you use the existing dex_pc_to_block_map_?  What is "copied_from"?  Is it needed on *every* MIR?  Is it exclusive with the other uses of meta - could it be added to the union? etc.

doubly linked? I worry about maintaining this given the fields are public :-/

Could you document the API here. Its not clear what the result means, the rewrite and same_bb arguments mean that you need to read the code to understand.
