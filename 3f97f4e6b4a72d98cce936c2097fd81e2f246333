Why do you think we need both classes? HBinaryOperation looks good enough to me.

This class is useful to handle static evaluation of arithmetic binary operations (especially in the latest versions of the CLs).  HBinaryOperation also includes comparisons and I was not sure initially whether they should be handled like arithmetic operations in the constant propagation pass.  I will check if I can get rid of HArithmeticBinaryOperation.
