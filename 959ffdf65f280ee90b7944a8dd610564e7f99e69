Could we set a timeout here? We did have infinite loops in dex2oat recently, which were only terminated by the watchdog. So I think it's safer to just set some arbitrary value...

Normally I use the timeout command to set timeouts, when calling 'adb shell dalvikvm ...', so I could just do the same when creating the host dex2oat command (in Executor.verifyOnHost(String)), and then report a dex2oat timeout appropriately. 

If dex2oat loops infinitely on the target, the aforementioned dalvikvm timeout will catch that, but it will be indistinguishable from a regular timeout of the VM's execution.
