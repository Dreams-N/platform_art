I eventually went with `dump_size_statistics' in PS4.

Given how small this is, how about adding them to OatDumper? And check whether the stats flag was set when you write things to file?

Yeah, but my intention was to extend this set of information beyond this embryo of statistics (in an upcoming PS or CL). Does it make sense?

I view oatdump as a tool that should emit all the information we want. So even not having the stats option works for me.

So I think it's fine if you just inline these fields in OatDumper.
