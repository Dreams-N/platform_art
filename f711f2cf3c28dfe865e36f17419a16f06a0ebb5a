@shertz, we might be missing some debugger events if the calling code isn't deoptimizeable. Hope this is a rare enough case. And we've agreed if there is code that's not deoptimizeable on stack when debugger attaches, debugger might be missing some events. Hopefully most of the code will enter jitted version after debugger attaches.
