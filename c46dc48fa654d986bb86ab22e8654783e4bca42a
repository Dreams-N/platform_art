nit: usually naming convention for options is '-X[no]option-name'

I see a mix of [no] and [disable] (e.g. DisableExplicitGC or NoDexFileFallback) and looking in the Ignore section, historically we used more [disable].

For me, disable is more revealing but I can change if you think strongly (don't really care).

It's just a style and consistency thing.

There are 3 [no]options (4 if we count an ignored one), 1 [no]-option, 1 DisabledOption, 

Right now this doesn't match any of those styles, it's disabled-option which is just introducing yet another type of name.

So I would just prefer we stick to an existing naming convention instead of introducing a new one (and the [no]option is the most popular right now).

If you really prefer 'disable' more, then how about '-XXDisableSigChain' which will make it more consistent with the other disable?
