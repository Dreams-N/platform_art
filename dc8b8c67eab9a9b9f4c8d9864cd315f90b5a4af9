Also, I think we need to have main_space == non_moving_space (that is, separate_non_moving_space = false) for GSS. Otherwise the zygote compaction won't work for GSS (and the device won't boot) since it does not compact from the main space to the non-moving space (only from the bump pointer space to the non-moving space).
