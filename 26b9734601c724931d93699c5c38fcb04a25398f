In such cases, it IMHO looks better to remove or comment out the parameter identifiers. Things will never be implemented, so it doesn't make sense to leave things "available."

In general I agree but it depends on the case as it may be useful to know what the parameters are in lieu of our sparse documentation. I've added ATTRIBUTE_UNUSED to mark parameters rather than having lots of UNUSED. This is also preferential as a compiler feature may have more checking (such as being able to check if an unused thing is really used). I've marked a large number of cases as ATTRIBUTE_UNUSED or removed the argument, but I haven't fully cleared out UNUSED as I expect this to be something to come back to in a different change.
