I believe the intent was to reserve space for argument words in the callee save frame, however, given the Method* is at the bottom this looks broken. Should we move the Method* to be at offset 24 with space for a0 to a3 below. This would also require adjusting the callee save frame sizes. I think there's inherently a collision between the Method* and a0 as things are.

Having the SETUP_REFS_ONLY.. include argument space would mean we could avoid these operations.

Remove the TODO? Also, need to add kMips in compiler_driver.cc to the list of architectures supporting generic JNI.
