I prefer 'Intersects' as the name.  Any other opinion?

I think we want to choose a naming scheme that can also be applied to the old BadOverlap as well.  In descriptive terms, the old BadOverlap() is a partial overlap, while the new IsIntersect() is either partial or full.

PartiallyOverlaps() & Overlaps()

PartiallyIntersects() and Intesects()

"Partially" isn't my favorite prefix word, though.  Any other suggestions?
