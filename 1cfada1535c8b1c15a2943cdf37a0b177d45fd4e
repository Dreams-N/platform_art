Unfortunately, you cannot run "make build-art-host-tests" (nor even "make build-art-host") on OS X, because these targets have a dependency on `out/host/darwin-x86/framework/core-oj-hostdex.jar` that cannot be satisfied (we don't build `*-hostdex.jar` files outside Linux).

You can build ART with "mmma art" though; I've updated the "Test:" stanza in PS2.
