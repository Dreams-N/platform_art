Was this difference introduced by your CL?  Or did you notice this difference while working on this CL?  If so, we may want to move this (as well as the changes to test/Android.run-test.mk) to another CL.

The difference is only revealed by this CL, in that the CFG is now generated on target instead of on host. The live ranges slightly differ.

I`ll extract the related changes in a separate commit.

Alright.  It makes sense. :)

Do you plan to have different CHECK stanzas for the various back ends?

With the current changes we would first need to have one test per arch:

    CHECK-START-X86: void Main ...
    CHECK:        ParameterValue liveness:2 ranges:{[2,222222)} ...

    CHECK-START-ARM: void Main ...
    CHECK:        ParameterValue liveness:2 ranges:{[2,444444)} ...

    ...


As discussed before, eventually we would like to be able to do something like

    CHECK-START: void Main ...
    CHECK-default:        ParameterValue liveness:2 ranges:{[2,222222)} ...
    CHECK-ARM:            ParameterValue liveness:2 ranges:{[2,444444)} ...
