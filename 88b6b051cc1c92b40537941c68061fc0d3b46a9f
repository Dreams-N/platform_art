One thing I never quite understood, if the data isn't owned how is it supposed to handle a resize safely?

It looks like that Resize will allocate and deallocate the storage regardless.

Is the intention here for a hashset of pointers, where removing an item from the hashset will also delete the pointer?

minor: shouldn't deallocate work with a nullptr? if it's just delete or free then it ignores nullptr
