So this is apparently not enough, as the test requires eg /system/framework/sconscrypt.jar, and this rule only builds the intemediate jar. I'm going to look at the non-phony rule that does install these jars. But maybe you know already?

I'm thinking the test should use use the files and helpers from CommonRuntimeTest and not have have its own hardwared list of jar dependencies, like this:

if that is not working, all CommonRuntimeTest setups should fail.
