This could be auto-generated if you add nodes.h to LIBART_COMPILER_ENUM_OPERATOR_OUT_HEADER_FILES?

There are a few other operator<<()s in nodes.h that could be auto-generated but we'd also have to ensure that the script doesn't pick up those that cannot. If someone wants to clean that up, I'll be happy to review the change.

Indeed; I went for the simple solution (already used for some other enums in compiler/optimizing/nodes.h) and implemented it myself. I'll take a look at whether we can generate all operators of this file automatically.
