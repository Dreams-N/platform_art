Is it worth adding some more macros here to reduce the excessive copy paste?

its unfortunate but the copy & paste is so that we can get new lines. The problem is a #define (even multi-line) turns into a single line. For ARM and MIPS we use a .macro of .macros but that fails with the OS/X tool chain and its different version of "as".
